How much is too much, they ask? Here is their pitch to chop Sailing:\n\nHow many of you own a boat? How many of you could get access to a boat and – checks notes – a sea to sail it in? Of all the many anachronisms at the modern Olympics, Sailing is perhaps the most conspicuous of all: a continuing sop to super-rich men who founded the Games and still just really love yachts, basically inaccessible to most of the countries in the world, even the ones with a viable coastline.\n\nPlus, it is basically unwatchable as a spectator sport, liable to be postponed if there is either no wind or too much wind, and has a set of penalty rules indecipherable to all but the most avid boat people, which as we’ve established, you are almost certainly not. – Full report\n\nEditor’s note: If you were wondering, yes, they also want to chop anything with a horse.\n\nParis 2024 Olympic Sailing Program:\nMen’s One Person Dinghy – ILCA 7\nWomen’s One Person Dinghy – ILCA 6\nMixed Two Person Dinghy – 470\nMen’s Skiff – 49er\nWomen’s Skiff – 49erFX\nMen’s Kiteboard – Formula Kite Class\nWomen’s Kiteboard – Formula Kite Class\nMen’s Windsurfing – iQFOiL\nWomen’s Windsurfing – iQFOiL\nMixed Multihull – Nacra 17\n\nVenue: Marseille, France\nDates: July 28-August 9\n\nDetails:\n• Paris website: https://www.paris2024.org/en/the-olympic-games-paris-2024/\n• World Sailing microsite: https://paris2024.sailing.org/\n\nTags: Jonathan Liew, Los Angeles 2028 Games, Olympic Games, Paris 2024 Games, The Irish Times\n\n Launched in 1997, Scuttlebutt provides sailing news with a North American focus.

Please try again later.\n\nThis was published 9 months ago\n\nAdd articles to your saved list and come back to them any time.\n\nBasketball is blizzarded in statistics, so one more won’t hurt. Of the 10,500 athletes in Paris for the Olympics, roughly 17 per cent were born after Lauren Jackson first suited up in the Games in 2000. They include two teammates with whom she shared a bronze medal on Sunday in a furiously fought out win over Belgium.\n\nJackson thus became the first Australian to win medals at five Olympics. The asterisk in that stat is that she missed two Olympics, one when injured, the other while retired and having children, and they are the only two Games in her time in which Australia did not win a medal.\n\nLauren Jackson wasn’t required on court against Belgium but was part of the Opals team that won the bronze medal.Credit: Eddie Jim\n\nAt least one Paris Olympian, a Chinese skateboarder, was born after Jackson retired for the first time.\n\nPerhaps the only thing Australia’s greatest basketballer doesn’t do well is retire, but surely at 43 she is out of time-outs?\n\n“I’ve been told that I have to say,” she said enigmatically, “that I’m just going to celebrate today.”\n\nJackson mark I was the world’s best basketballer for a while.\n\nJackson mark II has been as much a moral force as palpable.\n\nIn this tournament, she played just 20 minutes and scored six points. In the bronze-medal match, she sat on the bench throughout, her right leg wrapped not so much in a bandage as a casing, trying to make out that she was the one thing she can never be, just another player.\n\nThe Opals celebrate winning the bronze medal against Belgium.Credit: Getty Images\n\nShe’s a basketball treasure and so was handled with due care.\n\nFor her, this was the armchair ride she had given to so many others previously, complete with view.\n\n“The last four Olympics, I’ve had to play minutes and minutes and minutes, and I don’t remember,” she said. “I don’t have memories of what it felt like to get a medal. They’re very vague.\n\n“I’ve sat out this tournament and I’ve been able to watch every single minute of it, and that’s the difference for me right now, that I will remember this tournament and how special it is.”\n\nThe game was all sharp elbows and banging bodies, but there was a poetic element. Ezi Magbegor was one year old when Jackson first played at the Olympics. She’s sometimes called the next Lauren Jackson; a Bradmanesque curse.\n\nThis night, she played the game of her life, scoring a career-best 30 points, making 13 rebounds and generally inserting herself into the play at every crucial moment to tow the Opals over the line. FIBA rated her game the most efficient by any player, man or woman, in Olympic basketball history.\n\nEzi Magbegor dominated in Australia’s bronze medal win over Belgium.Credit: AP\n\nIt wasn’t just the what, but the how. Magbegor was an island of tranquillity in a sea of clashing passions.\n\nAustralian basketball needs a new face, and hers could launch 1000 championships.\n\n“Wow,” said Jackson. “Ezi is so talented, and I’m glad she had this game and platform today to see just how incredible she is. People have seen that now. Everyone knows how good she can be.\n\n“For Ez, it’s believing in herself. Tonight, she proved to herself that she can carry a team.”\n\nOn such matters, Jackson is a leading authority.\n\nMagbegor was humble about it.\n\n“I know it wasn’t the greatest tournament on an individual level,” she said. “It was the last game for a lot of our Opals, so being able to come out here and get a bronze for them means a lot.”\n\nShe might have pre-empted official announcements, but not by long. Five of this squad are 33 or older. All went to war for Australia one more time on Sunday and can look forward to peace.\n\nWhen the Opals next take the court, they will have a different complexion.\n\nJackson, for one, sees only encouraging signs.\n\n“I think the Opals now are on an upwards trajectory,” she said. “They know we’ve got this next generation of kids coming through that can absolutely lift.”\n\nThe grail, of course, is to put one over the Americans.\n\nEzi Magbegor did her best impression on a young Lauren Jackson in the bronze-medal game.Credit: Getty\n\n“I do believe we will knock them off at some point,” she said.\n\nWe, but no longer her. She has another team on her hands now.\n\n“It’s crazy to think that I’ve had two children and that they are here,” Jackson said. “When I had them, there was no thought I was ever going to set foot back on the basketball court again.\n\n“It’s been special. (Older son) Lenny’s always like, ‘Mum, why aren’t you getting on the court?’. I said, ‘you’ll understand when you’re my age’.\n\nAge in her case means era as much as years.\n\n“I’m glad we were able to send her off in her last game in a big way,” said heir apparent Magbegor.\n\n“Wherever she goes, she brings success. Her experience, whether she was on the floor or not, her vibe was felt throughout the team.”\n\nAs Australia and Belgium went at it hammer and tongs, Jackson metaphorically had one foot back over the fence. “The girls were remarkable,” she said. “I know it’s hard for the girls on court, but gee it was fun to watch.”\n\nWhen victory at last was assured, seconds before the end, the bench players group-hugged, then at the buzzer widened it to include the five on court.\n\nThe immortal Lauren Jackson was just one of the girls.

Social media was quickly flooded with excited messages praising the couple - with many quite taken by William's 'rugged' appearance. \n\nPrince William stood by her side in the Instagram video and sported an unusually rugged look, with an unshaven appearance\n\nA beaming Princess of Wales has sent a heartfelt message to British Olympians ahead of the end of the Paris Olympics , which will be formally closed tonight\n\nRoyal fan's' attentions were firmly on the Princess of Wales, whose public appearance in the video was one of only a handful this year - with the most recent being at the Wimbledon men's final (pictured)\n\nKate, who is continuing to undergo preventative chemotherapy, was positively glowing in her latest appearance in a special video shot for Team GB \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRoyal fans on social media gushed over the Princess of Wales \n\nAnother added: 'You (Kate and Will) both look amazing!!!

Thank you so much for everything. These memories will last a very long time.'\n\nRetired American sprinter and broadcaster Michael Johnson wryly said: 'Great job Team GB, you did a great job, not quite as good as us in the US, but well done.' \n\nFormer Welsh athlete Colin Jackson beamed with delight as he told the Olympians: 'You smashed it.'\n\nBroadcaster Emma Willis said it had been 'sensational to watch you over the last couple of weeks.' \n\nSwimmer Rebecca Adlington had huge praise for Team GB.

On behalf of Snoop Dogg, the Prince and his lovely wife,' before clasping his hands together and bowing his head. \n\nKate and William's beaming video came shortly after a heartfelt statement from King Charles III, in which he called all Olympians 'an inspiration'.\n\nThe monarch congratulated their 'outstanding successes' and singled out their 'raw talent, true grit and hard toil' in the message, which came just hours before the final moments of the Olympic Games in the French capital.\n\nA glittering closing ceremony will take place in the Stade de France at 9pm (8pm BST). \n\nFormer England captain and football icon David Beckham congratulated Team GB as broadcaster Gabby Logan said they had created 'memories that will last a lifetime'\n\nThe King has called all Olympians 'an inspiration' and congratulated their 'outstanding successes' in a heartfelt message sent to mark the closing of the Paris Olympics \n\nThe monarch's message was sent just hours after Emily Campbell celebrated a bronze medal in the women's 81kg+ weightlifting event on the last day of the competition\n\nAmber Anning, Victoria Ohuruogu, Nicole Yeargin and Laviai Nielsen of Team Great Britain celebrate Bronze in the Women's 4 x 400m final on Saturday\n\nIn his full statement he said: 'My wife joins me in sending our warmest congratulations to the competitors and their support teams from Team GB and across the whole Commonwealth, for their many outstanding successes at the Olympic Games in Paris.\n\n'Your achievements, across so many disciplines, were forged from that invaluable combination of raw talent, true grit and hard toil over many years, burnished these past weeks by sportsmanship and team spirit in the finest tradition of the Games.\n\n'To those who missed out on the greatest prizes, you have most certainly not fallen short in the pride that you, too, have generated for your nations.\n\n'As we thank France for hosting such a wonderful tournament and look to the Paralympics ahead, I can only say that you have all been an inspiration.'\n\nGreat Britain ended the Paris Olympics with 65 medals – the same amount won at London 2012 and the nation's second-best ever tally on foreign soil.\n\nThey came third behind the United States (126) and China (91).\n\nBut Team GB won eight fewer gold medals than in Tokyo three years ago and were 13 down on the 27 collected at Rio 2016.\n\nA final return of 14 gold, 22 silver and 29 bronze saw Britain slip to seventh spot in the medal table – its lowest place since finishing 10th at Athens 2004 – and third-best European nation behind hosts France and the Netherlands.\n\nTraditional Olympic sports such as athletics, cycling and swimming returned medals, while rowing banished its Tokyo nightmare to win three golds in a strong regatta.\n\nBut newer sports such as skateboarding, taekwondo and trampolining also had success, while Team GB won its first-ever medals in sport climbing.\n\nThere is no time for Team GB to rest however - it has already begun planning for the Los Angeles 2028 Games by securing Stanford University as its exclusive preparation camp.\n\nA star-studded show will bring an end to the two-week sporting spectacle on Sunday night.\n\nHollywood action man Tom Cruise is expected to bring a dramatic finale to the Paris 2024 Olympic Games, which has been hailed a roaring success despite torrential rain  and chaotic start.\n\nThe switch across the Atlantic will feature live performances by pop superstar Billie Eilish , LA rockers Red Hot Chili Peppers and Snoop Dogg\n\nHollywood action man Tom Cruise is expected to bring a dramatic finale to the Paris 2024 Olympic Games\n\nThe Mission Impossible star is set to abseil into the Stade de France stadium to pick up the five-ring Olympic flag and transfer it to Los Angeles, the host of the 2028 Games.\n\nThe switch across the Atlantic will feature live performances by pop superstar Billie Eilish, LA rockers Red Hot Chili Peppers and Snoop Dogg.\n\nThe regular appearance of the legendary rapper has been hailed by Olympic chiefs for helping introduce the Games to a record audience of half the world's population.\n\nThe Mission Impossible star is set to abseil into the Stade de France stadium to pick up the five-ring Olympic flag and transfer it to Los Angeles\n\nHeavy security around the closing ceremony stadium Stade de France, Saint-Denis, France\n\nBillie Eillish is set to perform in LA when the torch is handed over \n\n\n\t    Share what you think\n          \n\nThe comments below have not been moderated.\n\n\n      The views expressed in the contents above are those of our users and do not necessarily reflect the views of MailOnline.\n    \n\nWe are no longer accepting comments on this article.\n\nPublished by Associated Newspapers Ltd\n\nPart of the Daily Mail, The Mail on Sunday & Metro Media Group"

On Sunday, the IOC accepted the CAS ruling and asked for the return of Chiles’ medal.\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\tEditor’s picks\n\t\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThe 100 Best TV Episodes of All Time\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThe 250 Greatest Albums of the 21st Century So Far\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThe 500 Greatest Albums of All Time\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThe 200 Greatest Singers of All Time\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t“We firmly believe that Jordan rightfully earned the bronze medal, and there were critical errors in both the initial scoring by the International Gymnastics Federation (FIG) and the subsequent CAS appeal process that need to be addressed,” USA Gymnastics and the U.S. Olympic & Paralympic Committee said in a statement Sunday, adding they would appeal the IOC’s order.\n\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t“Given these circumstances, we are committed to pursuing an appeal to help Jordan Chiles receive the recognition she deserves.

On Sunday, the Public Enemy member took to social media to offer her a different award. “Ayyy YOOOO @ChilesJordan,” the rapper wrote, “imma make you a BRONZE CLOCK NECKLACE,,, and that’s something NO ONE else has,!!!

Whoever we put her with was injured.'\n\nHe said coaches only found a match for her after pairing her up with Jose Quiles, one of Spain's leading male boxers.\n\n'I don't see it as fair,' he said. 'Everyone can think what they want, but that's how I see it.'\n\nKhelif has been hailed as a national hero after dispatching China's Yang Liu in the final, and was selected as one of Algeria's flag bearers for the Olympic closing ceremony in Paris on Sunday.\n\nBut the success of Khelif, and of Taiwan's Gold medalist Lin Yu-Ting, has brought intense pressure on the International Olympic Committee (IOC) to tighten up who can compete in its women's categories.\n\nKhelif took the gold after a bout with Liu Yang of China on Friday, defying those who criticized her or spread misinformation about her gender\n\nSpanish national coach Rafa Lozano has revealed that Khelif was considered too dangerous to pair with women at a boxing retreat in Madrid ahead of the Olympics.\n\nThe organization has not conducted chromosomal tests since 1999, and stopped testing for elevated testosterone levels in 2021 after concluding that they prevented 'fairness, inclusion and non-discrimination on the basis of gender identify and sex variation'.\n\n'Everyone competing in the women's category is complying with the competition eligibility rules,' said IOC spokesman Mark Adams last week.\n\n'They are women in their passports and it's stated that this is the case, that they are female.'\n\nBut Carini was not the first former opponent to testify to the power of Khelif's punches.\n\nMexican boxer Brianda Tamara Cruz said she was lucky to escape with her life after sharing a ring with the Algerian at the Golden Belt Series Finals in Guadalajara in 2022.\n\n'When I fought her, I felt it was very out of my reach, I was hurt a lot by the punches,' she said.\n\n'I think I had never in my 13 years as a boxer felt like this, not even in my sparring with men.\n\n'Thank God, that day I came out of the ring well.'   \n\nOn Friday Olympics chief Thomas Bach again defended Khelif's right to box but added that he would be the first to adopt an agreed 'scientifically solid system'.\n\n'This system is working and so therefore our decision is clear,' he added. 'Women should be allowed to take part in women's competitions and the two are women.'\n\nThe IBA has refused to share further details of its tests, saying the 'specifics' would 'remain confidential', and Khelif has now filed a formal legal complaint with French prosecutors urging them to investigate online harassment.\n\n'Having just won a gold medal at the 2024 Paris Olympic Games, the boxer Imane Khelif has decided to take on a new fight: that of justice, dignity and honor,' her lawyer Nabil Boud said on Saturday.\n\n'Ms Khelif has recruited (our) firm which has filed, yesterday, a complaint for aggravated cyber harassment with the online hate unit of the Paris prosecutor's' office.\n\n'The criminal investigation will determine who has initiated this misogynistic, racist and sexist campaign but will also focus on who has fed this digital lynching.\n\n'The unfair harassment suffered by this champion boxer will remain the greatest stain of these Olympic Games.'\n\nKhelif was banned from the International Boxing Association's (IBA) Women's World Boxing Championships in New Delhi last year after tests indicated she had XY chromosomes\n\nBut she won gold on Friday in the face of online hatred and claims that she is 'biologically male'\n\nKhelif has lodged a complaint with French police against aggravated cyber harassment and slammed critics who 'cannot digest my success' \n\nThe 25-year-old welterweight is now a national hero and was selected as one of Algeria's flag bearers for the Olympic closing ceremony in Paris on Sunday.\n\nBut in its own statement, the IBA condemned 'inconsistencies in eligibility' at the Paris Games, adding: 'Both Imane Khelif and Lin Yu-ting post testing, did not meet the required eligibility criteria to compete within the female category of our respective events.\n\n'The urgent nature of the decision (to disqualify the boxers) was justified, as the safety of our boxers is our top priority.'\n\nKhelif told a press conference after winning her medal: 'I am a woman like any woman. I was born a woman and I have lived as a woman but there are enemies to success and they can't digest my success.'\n\nShe later added: 'All that is being said about me on social media is immoral. I want to change the minds of people around the world.'\n\n\n\t    Share what you think\n          \n\nThe comments below have not been moderated.\n\n\n      The views expressed in the contents above are those of our users and do not necessarily reflect the views of MailOnline.\n    \n\nBy posting your comment you agree to our house rules.\n\nDo you want to automatically post your MailOnline comments to your Facebook Timeline?\n\nYour comment will be posted to MailOnline as usual.\n\n \n\nDo you want to automatically post your MailOnline comments to your Facebook Timeline?\n\nYour comment will be posted to MailOnline as usual\n\n  We will automatically post your comment and a link to the news story to your Facebook timeline at the same time it is posted on MailOnline.

Zii Jia went on to win a bronze medal after beating Lakshya Sen of India in the playoff for the medal.\n\nAll the world’s top 10 players in the men’s singles have registered for the tournament, including Denmark’s world No. 2 and two-time Olympic champion Axelsen.\n\nIndonesia’s Jonatan Christie (No. 5) and Anthony Ginting (No. 9) who also suffered early blows in the Olympics will try to turn around their fortunes in Japan.\n\nBesides Zii Jia, Malaysia will also be represented in the men’s singles by world No. 27 Leong Jun Hao.\n\nJun Hao only started competing in World Tour 750 and 1000 competitions at the end of May but impressed by taking down the likes of Jonatan, Anthony and Tien-chen en route to reaching the last eight in the Singapore and Indonesian Opens.\n\nThe 25-year-old will be keen to continue his good form after a two-month break from tournaments.\n\nThe draw for the competition will be released tomorrow.\n\nThank you for your report!\n\nCopyright © 1995-\n            \n\n Star Media Group Berhad [197101000523 (10894-D)]\n\nBest viewed on Chrome browsers.\n\n\n\nWe would love to keep you posted on the latest promotion.

        "expanded content": "AU\n\nParis has set a very high bar for 2028 hosts Los Angeles, say veterans\n\nWhat was the star of one of the \"all-time great\" Olympics? It was quite simply Paris, due to the imagination of the organisers in placing temporary venues among world-renowned landmarks.\n\nThat is the view of Hugh Robertson, the British minister responsible for delivering the 2012 London Games, and two former IOC executives.\n\nFrom beach volleyball at the Eiffel Tower to the elegant surroundings of the Palace of Versailles for the equestrian events and the grandeur of the Grand Palais for fencing and taekwondo, the Paris Games were a veritable tourists' guide to the \"City of Light\".\n\nMichael Payne, a former head of marketing at the IOC, said that in terms of legacy Paris had succeeded in ensuring the \"Olympics are clearly back\" after \"the chaos of Rio\" and the Covid-affected 2021 Tokyo edition.\n\n\"These Games will go down as one of the all-time great Olympic Games,\" the 66-year-old Irishman told AFP.\n\n\"The presentation of Paris as one massive Olympic venue, with its incredible iconic buildings as a backdrop, has had a massive impact on the TV ratings around the world,\" he added.\n\nTerrence Burns, another former IOC marketing executive, told AFP he thinks Paris has set a \"very high bar\" for the 2028 hosts Los Angeles.\n\n\"Each Games brings something unique,\" the American told AFP.\n\n\"This one will be remembered as much for the city as the Games that took place in it.\n\n\"So much was riding on the success of Paris 2024.\n\n\"Each venue felt like a piece of history and I loved how they used the city itself as the canvas upon which to paint a beautiful Games -- unmatched.\"\n\nRobertson, a former Conservative lawmaker in Britain who has been the head of the British Olympic Association since 2016, says London's Olympic Park from 2012 with \"traditional stadia all over it\" may be the last of its kind.\n\n\"If there is one thing I really learned from Paris, it is using temporary venues in stunning locations,\" he told AFP.\n\n\"Future hosts should use it as a template in not building permanent stadia and instead putting temporary stands in beautiful locations.\"\n\nPayne, who oversaw a transformation in the IOC's brand and sponsorship during his two decades there, believes what the organisers did in exploiting Paris's landmarks and natural beauty will be a game changer for bid cities.\n\n\"I think Paris, with their venues throughout the city, set against iconic stunning backdrops (and no major new sports infrastructure built), will kickstart a whole new era in cities wanting to host the Olympic Games, much as Barcelona 1992 did,\" he said.\n\nRobertson said one venue stood out for him -- appropriately where Team GB enjoyed success in what is his final bow.\n\n\"The equestrian venue at Versailles was stunning, one of the greatest venues of all time,\" said the 61-year-old.\n\n\"Sitting in that bowl looking out with the Palace of Versailles in the background, I cannot think of a better venue in the five Games I have been to.\"\n\nBurns has attended many Games but even his breath was taken away by one of the venues.\n\n\"The beach volleyball venue was the most amazing setting for any sporting event I've ever seen,\" he said.\n\nAs for the revolutionary opening ceremony with a parade on the River Seine, Burns was lukewarm, preferring the tradition of the athletes coming together in a stadium, but Robertson felt it worked brilliantly.\n\n\"It was very important it got the French people behind the Games and to that extent it succeeded,\" he said.\n\nCOMMENTS \n\nComments are moderated and generally will be posted if

Unless you’re offended by “dreamlike, dystopian” stories about a time traveler from another planet who lands on Earth to find it pretty much like Charlton Heston did, only without the monkeys.\n\nAccording to the program, the “Golden Voyager” takes back a few souvenirs excavated from these Games with the intent of recreating what transpired here over the last two weeks.\n\nGood luck with that, Goldy.\n\nThe French pulled off an extravaganza that isn’t likely to be duplicated anytime soon. The facilities were grand as well as accessible, the weather gorgeous, athletes spectacular and the trains ran on time.\n\nGet the latest D-FW sports news, analysis and opinion delivered straight to your inbox. Plus, Kevin Sherrington's A La Carte.\n\nOr with: \n\nBy signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy\n\nJuan Antonio Samaranch, who ran the International Olympic Committee for more than two decades, was famous for pronouncing each Olympics the “best ever.” Thomas Bach, the current president, only called this one “a magnificent stage.” Not good enough. None of the nine previous Olympics in my 32-year experience comes close.\n\nBill Hancock, who helps out the USOPC in his off-time, has worked every Summer Olympics since 1984 and would claim as many winters, too, if he hadn’t been otherwise occupied running the NCAA Tournament or the College Football Playoff.\n\nHe figured the scenery here would be nice. City of Lights, and all that.\n\nBut what about the logistics?\n\n“Man,” Hancock said, “they hit the lights and the nuts and bolts.”\n\nThat left it up to the athletes, who didn’t disappoint, even if it wasn’t necessarily in a historic sense. Only 17 world records were broken, down from 20 in Tokyo and a high of 30 in 2008. An associate professor of applied sciences at the University of Birmingham told Sky News that we’ve probably reached a point of “diminishing returns” because of advances made in training since the Atlanta Olympics in 1996.\n\n“What we’re seeing now,” Thomas Brownlee told the site, “is that everyone’s kind of catching up and doing similar stuff.\n\n“The secrets are out a little bit.”\n\nDoesn’t mean the competition wasn’t as exhilarating as ever. Both the men’s and women’s gold-medal basketball games between the Americans and their hosts were barn-burners. Noah Lyles won the closest 100 meters in modern history. Katie Ledecky still rules the pool. Simone Biles reclaimed her throne and then crowned her successor, Brazil’s Rebeca Andrade, in one of the Games’ most magnanimous gestures.\n\nIn the medal count, a late kick at the tape by the U.S. earned it a tie with China at 40 golds, with the Americans leading overall medals, 126-91.\n\nThe rest of the world showed up, too. France’s Leon Marchand, who competed at Arizona State, made his home nation proud with four gold medals in swimming. Mijain Lopez, a 41-year-old Cuban wrestler, became the first athlete to win gold at five consecutive Olympics and retired on the spot. Turkish shooter Yusuf Dikec’s insouciance – a finger on the trigger, hand in his pocket – made him a man of a million memes.\n\nAnd in a demonstration of the spirit the Olympics are supposed to be about, the table tennis teams from North and South Korea took selfies together on the medal stand.\n\nThe good vibes were good for ratings, which were up 76% over Tokyo, a victim of COVID and a bad time slot. An NBC representative told the Los Angeles Times that it expected ad revenues to far exceed its projections of $1.25 billion, making it the largest money-maker for any event in television history.\n\nOf course, not everything was hearts and flowers. A court disallowed the appeal that had enabled Jordan Chiles to win bronze in the floor routine, the final indignity after the Spring gymnast had been harassed online for not giving it back. Algerian boxer Imane Khelif suffered such abuse from critics sure she must be a man, despite certified testing and evidence of a lifetime lived otherwise, she filed a complaint with Paris officials.\n\n“I am a woman like any other,” she felt forced to testify. Actually, she’s a woman with a gold medal, and no one’s taking it.\n\nThe appeal of social media, I suppose, is it makes anyone and everyone an expert on everything. Anne Hidalgo, Paris’ mayor, issued a statement midway through the Games supporting Thomas Jolly, the artistic director of the opening ceremonies, after Jolly received death threats from viewers who interpreted some scenes as a blasphemous parody of the Last Supper. Paris 2024 officials subsequently apologized if anyone was offended, which was nice but unnecessary.\n\nTurns out the scenes in question were a parody of “The Feast of the Gods,” a Dutch painting, not Leonardo da Vinci’s masterpiece.\n\nFrankly, I thought the opening ceremonies were spectacular. Best ever, and I’m a sucker for these things. Better, for sure, than the closing, though it gets points for Tom Cruise’s drop-in and a cameo by Dallas’ Michael Johnson.\n\nOtherwise the handoff of the Olympic flag from Paris’ mayor to Los Angeles’ went just fine, probably because it wasn’t choreographed by the U.S. men’s 4x100. LA will have a hard time picking up where Paris left off, though. Even all the anxiety about the swimmability of the Seine proved to be much ado-doo about nothing.\n\nJust the same, I’m not taking a dip before coming home to the lovely wife. I’ll take their word for it. They got everything else right.\n\nTwitter/X: @KSherringtonDMN\n\nFind more Olympics coverage from The Dallas Morning News here.\n\nEmployed since 1985 by The Dallas Morning News, my fifth and final newspaper.

Three rings were added to the O’s of the famed Hollywood sign to create five interlaced Olympic rings.\n\nIt was just one of the highlights of the closing ceremony that put a final flourish to Paris’ first Games in a century, with an artistic show that celebrated Olympic themes, golden fireworks and thousands of athletes partying into the night.\n\nActor Tom Cruise jumps from the roof of the Stade de France during the 2024 Paris Olympics closing ceremony, Saint-Denis, France, Aug. 11, 2024. . Photo by Phil Noble/Reuters\n\nIn their enthusiasm, crowds of athletes rushed the stage during a highlight video from the Games, and stadium announcements in French and English urged them to double back. Some of them stayed, surrounding Grammy-winning French pop-rock band Phoenix as they played, before security and volunteers cleared the stage.\n\nFor Los Angeles, topping Paris could be mission impossible. The French capital made spectacular use of its cityscape for its first Games in 100 years. The Eiffel Tower and other iconic monuments became Olympic stars in their own right, serving as backdrops and in some cases venues for competitions.\n\nBut LA was bringing star power of its own: singer Billie Eilish, the Red Hot Chili Peppers, rapper and Paris Olympics mainstay Snoop Dogg — plus longtime collaborator Dr. Dre — performed at Venice Beach as part of the handover from the City of Light to the City of Angels.\n\nEach of the music artists is a California native, including H.E.R., who sang the U.S. national anthem live at the Stade de France, which hosted Olympic track and field and rugby sevens. The audience was expected to top 70,000 people.\n\nAt the start of the show, the stadium crowd roared as French swimmer Léon Marchand, dressed in a suit and tie instead of the swim trunks he wore to win four golds, was shown on the giant screens collecting the Olympic flame from the Tuileries Gardens in Paris.\n\nThere, the Olympic cauldron — powered by electricity instead of fossil fuels — had lit up the French capital for the duration of the Games, thrilling crowds by rising into the skies on a balloon every night.\n\nFlagbearers carry flags during the 2024 Paris Olympics closing ceremony, Stade de France, Saint-Denis, France, Aug. 11, 2024. Photo by Albert Gea/Reuters\n\nAs a delicate pink sunset gave way to night, athletes marched into the stadium waving the flags of their 205 countries and territories — a display of global unity in a world gripped by global tensions and conflicts, including those in Ukraine and Gaza. The stadium screens carried the words, “Together, united for peace.”\n\nWith the 329 medal events finished, the expected 9,000 athletes — many wearing their shiny medals — and team staffers filled the arena, dancing and cheering to thumping beats.\n\nWATCH: A look at Team USA’s golden run at the Olympics in Paris\n\nUnlike in Tokyo in 2021, where the Games were pushed back a year by the COVID-19 pandemic and largely stripped of fans, athletes and the more than 70,000 spectators at the Paris arena celebrated with abandon, singing together as Queen’s anthem “We Are the Champions” blared. Multiple French athletes crowd-surfed. U.S. team members jumped up and down in their Ralph Lauren jackets.\n\nIn a speech, International Olympic Committee President Thomas Bach — who sat with French President Emmanuel Macron during the show — said the Games “can create a cultural peace that inspires the world,” noting that the athletes “respected each other even if your countries are divided by conflict.”\n\nUnited States athletes celebrate during the closing ceremony for the Paris 2024 Olympic Summer Games at Stade de France, Saint-Denis, France, Aug. 11, 2024 . Photo by Rob Schumacher/USA TODAY Sports via Reuters\n\nThe national stadium, France’s largest, was one of the targets of Islamic State gunmen and suicide bombers who killed 130 people in and around Paris on Nov. 13, 2015. The joy and celebrations that swept Paris during the Games as Marchand and other French athletes racked up 64 medals — 16 of them gold — marked a major watershed in the city’s recovery from that night of terror.\n\nThe closing ceremony saw the awarding of the last medals — each embedded with a chunk of the Eiffel Tower. Fittingly for the first Olympics that aimed for gender parity, they all went to women — the gold, silver and bronze medalists from the women’s marathon earlier Sunday.\n\nWATCH: Exploring the history of gender equity at the Olympics and where things stand today\n\nThe women’s marathon took the spot of the men’s race that traditionally closed out previous Games. The switch was part of efforts in Paris to make the Olympic spotlight shine more brightly on the sporting feats of women. Paris was also where women first made their Olympic debut, at the Games of 1900.\n\nThe U.S. team again topped the medal table, with 126 in all and 40 of them gold. Three were courtesy of gymnast Simone Biles, who made a resounding return to the top of the Olympic podium after prioritizing her mental health instead of competition in Tokyo in 2021.\n\nUnlike Paris’ rain-drenched but exuberant opening ceremony that played out along the Seine River in the heart of city, the closing ceremony’s artistic portion took a more sober approach, with space-age and Olympic themes.\n\nThe Golden Voyager performs during the formation and raising of the Olympic Rings during the 2024 Paris Olympics closing ceremony, Stade de France, Saint-Denis, France, Aug. 11, 2024.. Photo by Phil Noble/Reuters\n\nA golden-shrouded figure dropped spider-like from the skies into a darkened world of smoke and swirling stars. Olympic symbols were celebrated, including the flag of Greece, birthplace of the ancient Games, and the five interlaced Olympic rings, lit up in white in the arena where tens of thousands of lights glittered like fireflies.\n\nThomas Jolly, the artistic director of both shows, had faced blowback for portions of the opening ceremony, which were assailed by former U.S. President Donald Trump, French bishops and others who felt they poked fun at Christianity.\n\nJolly and other members of his creative team filed police complaints over death threats and online vitriol targeting them and some of opening show’s performers.\n\nCritics jumped to the conclusion that a segment featuring drag queens and a DJ who is also an LGBTQ+ icon had parodied “The Last Supper,” Leonardo Da Vinci’s painting showing Jesus Christ.\n\nJolly and his team repeatedly insisted that was never their intention and got backing from Macron, who described himself as “outraged and sad” by the backlash against them.\n\n\n                    Your tax-deductible donation ensures our vital reporting continues to thrive. \n                \n\n\nLeft:\n                Mayor of Los Angeles Karen Bass waves the Olympic flag during the 2024 Paris Olympics closing ceremony, Stade de France, Saint-Denis, France, Aug. 11, 2024.

        "expanded content": "Follow:\n\n\n            It was a party in the Stade de France as an electric two-and-a-half weeks of the Summer Olympics wrapped up on Sunday with a celebration of the athletes, the people who made the Games happen and a preview of what to expect in four years.\n    \n\n\n            Here are five takeaways from the closing ceremony of the Paris 2024 Summer Olympics:\n    \n\n\n            They were everywhere in Paris during these Olympic Games and helped people from around the world find their way around venues, around the city and just generally get themselves sorted out. The volunteers of Paris 2024 deserved a huge thank you and they got one to start off the closing ceremony.\n    \n\n\n            Clad in green shirts and green pants for the last two-plus weeks, they were ever present at all hours of the competition. When they streamed into the Stade de France along with the flagbearers, they received a huge roar from the always vociferous French crowd.\n    \n\n\n            The sports are obviously the central part of the Olympic Games, but they don’t work without an army of volunteers spread throughout the host city, helping fans from around the globe find their way around.\n    \n\n\n            It was a wonderful gesture from Games organizers and an incredible moment for the volunteers to be able to be thanked by tens of thousands of people who they helped during their time in Paris.\n    \n\n\n            The closing ceremony’s parade of nations was a celebration from the start. Athletes ready to relax and celebrate after completing years of training for these last two weeks were excited to pump up the fans in the stands and mingle with their teammates.\n    \n\n\n            After most of the athletes entered the stadium, it was time for a little karaoke with 80,000 people all singing together.\n    \n\n\n            First, there were a couple of French songs, but then the moment came as it had so many times at venues over the last weeks: Gala Rizzatto’s “Freed From Desire” came on through the loudspeakers.\n    \n\n\n            It might as well have been the unofficial anthem of these Games and was a crowd pleaser at every venue in which it was played. Finally, it was the athletes’ turn to partake in the dancing and singing.\n    \n\n\n            The thousands of competitors danced and jumped right along with the crowd in the stands, everyone letting loose a joyous energy that came from the competition finally being over so athletes and fans alike could come together in celebration of a truly splendid Olympics.\n    \n\n\n            From the opening ceremony’s amazing display on the Eiffel Tower to pre-competition displays, light shows were a hallmark of these Olympics. For the closing ceremony, organizers had one last trick up their sleeves.\n    \n\n\n            As dancers performed on the stage below, the lights at the Stade de France went out and tens of thousands of wristbands lit up all at once, illuminating the stadium as the sun fully set.\n    \n\n\n            From there, the Bluetooth-synced wristbands proceeded to not only flash and blink in time with each other, but individual sections of fans were unwittingly part of the show with their wristbands showing scenes of athletic competition moving across entire ends of the stadium.\n    \n\n\n            It was a truly breathtaking display that ended in the Olympic rings being raised above the stage in the center of the stadium, and the wristbands of the fans on all four sides of the venue being illuminated in their iconic image. It was a performance of synchronization across such a large scale that was truly impressive to see.\n    \n\n\n            After the light show and dancers concluded, it was time for the musical performance of the evening. The athletes were released from the assigned areas around the stage and encouraged to get up close to it. Many of them went a little further than that.\n    \n\n\n            Athletes began climbing onto the stage that was shaped like the continents, running around and soaking in the cheers of the fans. It was a moment of exuberance that wasn’t exactly welcomed by the people producing the show – multiple announcements were made over the stadium’s loudspeaker asking the athletes, politely, to get off the stage.\n    \n\n\n            Some of them heard that announcement and complied. Most of them heard that announcement and decided it would be more fun to dance around French indie rock band Phoenix as they launched into their set.\n    \n\n\n            It was an incredible sight. Scores of athletes huddled around a rock band like they were playing a tiny show at a local music venue, dancing and jumping around as they waved their country’s flags. Elsewhere, some athletes left the stage while others just went to other areas and danced and interacted with the crowd from there.\n    \n\n\n            Eventually, organizers got all the athletes down and allowed the performers to have their space. But for one incredible moment, there was nearly a mosh pit in the center of the Olympics’ closing ceremony.\n    \n\n\n            There’s a certain order to how these things go at the end of an Olympics. The Olympic flag is lowered, handed to the host city’s mayor for a final wave and then to the president of the International Olympic Committee to give it to the mayor of the next host city.\n    \n\n\n            At no point does that pomp and circumstance require a Hollywood A-lister to jump from the roof of a building, abscond with the flag, find a motorcycle and ride out of the stadium with it. And yet, that’s exactly what happened here on Sunday.\n    \n\n\n            As Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass handed the flag to US gymnastics legend Simone Biles, a spotlight suddenly flashed to the top of the Stade de France where Tom Cruise – who famously does all his own stunts – was standing.\n    \n\n\n            And then suddenly he was falling. Attached to a cable, Cruise jumped from the stadium’s roof to the field below, making his way through the assembled athletes to Bass and Biles. Cruise was handed the Olympic flag and gave it a wave before he went back into the crowd of athletes.\n    \n\n\n            Inexplicably waiting for him below was a motorcycle. And in true action star fashion, Cruise hopped on the bike and fired it up, riding out through the tunnel of the stadium. Video screens quickly showed him riding through the streets of Paris with the flag, heading for an airport where he boarded a plane and flew the flag to Hollywood.\n    \n\n\n            Eventually, after some more Cruise hijinks and sweeping shots of the SoCal landscape, the flag arrived at the beach where the Red Hot Chili Peppers, Billie Eilish, Snoop Dogg and Dr. Dre were waiting for it. It was an extremely LA way to begin the next Olympiad and definitely set an early tone for what to expect in the City of Angels four years from now.\n    \n\n© 2025 Cable News Network. A Warner Bros.

I felt so incredibly nervous going into this, knowing it was my last Olympics.\n\n\"There was a lot of pressure and expectations. I was eager for it to be done. But when I walked out and saw my husband (Lance) and kids (Robbie and Phoenix) and my friends and family in the audience, I was like, you know what? This is exactly why I did this.\"\n\nDaley, pictured below in 2011, added: \"It was emotional at the end, up there on the platform, knowing it was going to be my last competitive dive.\n\n\"But I have to make the decision at some point, and it feels like the right time.

Everyone in France was worried about the games beforehand but it has been a great success.\"\n\nDespite a stellar Olympics in Paris, Team GB only just break into the Top 25 in the Olympic medals per capita table, according to research.\n\nThe study, from BonusCodeBets, shows that the Brits rank 25th when considering the medals they have won relative to their population – and only just beating hosts France.\n\nCaribbean nations continue to outperform their populations, with four appearing in the top 10 of per-capita medal winners – Grenada, Dominica, Saint Lucia and Jamaica.\n\nDominica top the list when looking exclusively at gold medals – Thea LaFond winning gold in the triple jump for the only Olympic medal that the country has earned in its history, one for every 72,412 people.\n\nTeam GB won the country's 1,000th medal in OIympic history during the games.\n\nThe total haul of 65 medals meant Great Britain topped 60 medals for the fourth games on a trot having not achieved that feat for the previous 104 years when the country received 146 medals at the London games in 1908.\n\nTeam GB said au revoir to Paris today as they headed home after a memorable Olympics.\n\nA brass band played Beatles songs and God Save the King as hundreds of athletes and support staff caught the Eurostar at Gare du Nord to travel to London.\n\nThose on the train home included speed queen Emma Finucane who made history by winning the three cycling medals.\n\nShe was the first Brit woman to grab a hat-trick of gongs at a games for 60 years since Mary Rand achieved the feat in Tokyo in 1964.\n\nFinucane, 21, of Carmarthen, south Wales, had been supported by her family who travelled to Paris in a camper van.\n\nThe Paris Olympics charmed the world and reaffirmed French national pride - but President Macron now faces pressure to name a prime minister and let political parties negotiate.\n\nWith Sunday's closing ceremony over, President Emmanuel Macron must deal with a self-created political crisis that he had swept under the carpet until the Games were over.\n\nTalks over government jobs and budget cuts loom, with voter anger sure to follow.\n\n\"Now we have to wake up from this beautiful dream,\" said Christine Frant, 64, at the Club France fan zone last weekend. \"Such a shame we're going to return to our day-to-day routine, with no government, squabbles in parliament, while here it was all about joy, sharing.\"\n\n\n\nSouth Korea has deployed a bedbug sniffer dog at its main Incheon international airport in a bid to reduce the risk of the tiny insects entering the country when athletes, officials and fans return from the Paris Olympics.\n\nLeading the campaign is a two-year-old beagle named Ceco, below, who pest control company Cesco said is the first and so far only canine trained in the country to detect the odour of pheromones, the chemicals released by bedbugs.\n\nCeco is capable of sweeping a standard hotel room in under two minutes, company official Kim Min-su said.\n\nRed Hot Chili Peppers, pictured below with Dr Dre and Snoop Dogg, performed at the LA handover ceremony.\n\nAlso appearing was Billy Eilish.\n\n\n\nTeam Great Britain finished Paris 2024 with 65 medals, beating their total from Tokyo by one.\n\nThe total matches the team's medal haul from London 2012 and is the joint-third-highest for Team GB at a single Games behind Rio 2016 (67 medals) and London 1908 (146).\n\nBut GB did get eight fewer golds than they did three years ago in Tokyo.\n\nIn fact 14 golds was only good enough for seventh in the medal table, GB's lowest placing since Athens 2004.\n\nThere were lots of highs for Team GB - and a fair few lows, including Jack Carlin crashing in the men's Kierin cycling final, below.\n\n©News Group Newspapers Limited in England No. 679215 Registered office: 1 London Bridge Street, London, SE1 9GF. \"The Sun\", \"Sun\", \"Sun Online\" are registered trademarks or trade names of News Group Newspapers Limited.

The federation, known as FIG, said while it has restored the initial order of finish — with Barbosu third, Romanian teammate Sabrina Maneca-Voinea fourth and Chiles fifth — the allocation of medals was up to the International Olympic Committee.\n\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tRelated Stories\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\tTV\n\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tInside IMG's Huge Sports Production Weekend: From English, U.S., Saudi Soccer to Basketball and F1\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\tTV\n\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tHow to Watch 'Not Her First Rodeo,' New Docuseries Following Elite Female Bull Riders, Online Free\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\tFIG made the decision not long after the Court of Arbitration for Sport voided an appeal from Team USA coach Cecile Landi during the competition that had vaulted Chiles onto the podium.\n\n\n\tCAS ruled Saturday that the on-floor appeal Monday by Cecile Landi to have .1 added to Chiles’ score came outside the 1-minute window allowed by the FIG. The ad hoc committee wrote that Landi’s appeal came 1 minute, 4 seconds after the score was posted.\n\n\n\tCAS wrote that the initial finishing order should be restored, with Barbosu third, Maneca-Voinea fourth and Chiles fifth. The organization added the FIG should determine the final ranking “in accordance with the above decision,” but left it to FIG to decide who would get the medal behind gold winner Rebeca Andrade of Brazil and silver medalist Simone Biles of the U.S.\n\n\n\tFIG spokesperson Meike Behrensen said in an email to The Associated Press that “Reallocation of medals is the responsibility of the IOC.”\n\n\n\tAt the Olympics, the governing body of each sport manages the competition and decides the results. The IOC typically accepts that result — once appeals to CAS are completed — and formally awards the medals. It’s unclear if the IOC or FIG would ask Chiles to return her medal. The gymnast is already back in the United States.\n\n\n\tThe IOC did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\n\n\tThe Romanian Gymnastics Federation had asked for three bronze medals to be awarded. Romanian prime minister Marcel Ciolacu reacted to the ruling by saying “justice has been served” and that “in the end, the truth prevailed.”\n\n\n\tThe ruling adds another layer to what has been a difficult few days for all three athletes. Romanian gymnastics legend and 1976 Olympic champion Nadia Comaneci feared for Barbosu’s mental health because of the wrenching sequence in which she went from bronze medalist to fourth-place finisher.\n\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t“I can’t believe we play with athletes mental health and emotions like this… let’s protect them,” Comaneci posted on X earlier in the week.\n\n\n\tComaneci, at the same time, criticized the judges for the way they scored Maneca-Voinea’s routine — the gymnast was docked 0.1 points for stepping out of bounds, but viral replays showed she narrowly stayed inbounds. Comaneci urged the Romanian Olympic Committee to protest, which it did, but CAS denied that appeal.\n\n\n\tChiles hinted at the decision in an Instagram Story on Saturday, indicating she is heartbroken and is “taking this time and removing myself from social media for my mental health, thank you.”\n\n\n\tBarbosu and Maneca-Voinea were left outside the medals in the floor final after finishing with matching scores of 13.700. Barbosu thought she had won bronze over Maneca-Voinea via a tiebreaker — a higher execution score — and began celebrating with a Romanian flag.\n\n\n\tChiles was the last athlete to compete and initially given a score of 13.666 that placed her fifth, right behind Maneca-Voinea. Landi called for an inquiry on Chiles’ score.\n\n\n\t“At this point, we had nothing to lose, so I was like ‘We’re just going to try,’” Landi said after the awards ceremony. “I honestly didn’t think it was going to happen, but when I heard her scream, I turned around and was like ‘What?’”\n\n\n\tJudges awarded the appeal, leapfrogging Chiles past Barbosu and Maneca-Voinea for the last spot on the podium.\n\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\tUSA Gymnastics said in a statement it is “devastated” by the ruling.\n\n\n\t“The inquiry into the Difficulty Value of Jordan Chiles’ floor exercise routine was filed in good faith and, we believed, in accordance with FIG rules to ensure accurate scoring,” the organization wrote.\n\n\n\tThe 23-year-old Chiles became a target on social media in the aftermath of the late switch, with critics asking her to give back the medal or offering racist remarks. Chiles posted on X earlier this week that “it’s funny how people can still never be happy for someone.”\n\n\n\t“Sending you so much love Jordan,” Biles posted on Instagram. “Keep your chin up ‘Olympic champ’ we love you.”\n\n\n\t“All this talk about the athlete, what about the judges?,” teammate Sunisa Lee added on Instagram. “Completely unacceptable, this is awful and I’m gutted for jordan.”\n\n\n\tBarbosu made it a point after returning home to Romania that she had no problem with Chiles.\n\n\n\t“I only want for everybody to be fair, we don’t want to start picking on other athletes of any nationality,” Barbosu told reporters. “We as athletes don’t deserve something like that, we only want to perform as best as we can and to be rewarded based on our performance. The problems lie with the judges, with their calculations and decisions.”\n\n\n\tChiles’ mother, Gina Chiles, called out the critics in a post, writing she was “tired” of the derogatory comments being leveled at Jordan.\n\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t“My daughter is a highly decorated Olympian with the biggest heart and a level of sportsmanship that is unmatched,” Gina Chiles posted. “And she’s being called disgusting things.”\n\n\n\tThe uncertainty also tinges what had been a beautiful moment on the medal stand, when Chiles and Biles knelt to honor Andrade after the Brazilian star won her fourth medal in Paris.\n\n\n\t“It was just the right thing to do,” Biles said about a moment that soon went viral, with even the Louvre itself suggesting it might be worthy enough for a spot somewhere in the vicinity of the Mona Lisa.\n\n\n\tThat memory now carries a complicated and emotional postscript.\n\nSign up for THR news straight to your inbox every day\n\nSign up for THR news straight to your inbox every day\n\nSubscribe for full access to The Hollywood Reporter\n\nSend us a tip using our anonymous form."

Here are the final Team Canada athletes that you don’t want to miss out on.\n\nTeam Canada Athletes Competing Today\n\nAs is tradition, the marathon event will take place on the final day of competition at the Olympic Games. Paris 2024, however, will mark the first time that the women’s marathon, rather than the men’s marathon, will hold this historic final spot–an homage to the Paris Games being the first Olympic Games to achieve gender parity.\n\nTeam Canada will be represented in the event by Malindi Elmore, who made her Olympic debut 20 years ago as a middle-distance athlete. She returned to the Olympics as a marathoner at Tokyo 2020, where she secured a top-10 finish for Canada with a ninth place overall.\n\nThe marathon will start at 8:00 a.m. local time / 2:00 a.m. ET.\n\nParis 2024 Competition Schedule\n\nCompetition at the velodrome will begin at 11:00 a.m. local time / 5:00 a.m. ET. Maggie Coles-Lyster will compete in the women’s omnium, which includes four different races. James Hedgcock and Nick Wammes will compete in the quarterfinals of the men’s keirin, aiming to advance to the semifinals and then the final.  \n\nKelsey Mitchell will compete in the women’s sprint 5th-8th classification.\n\nThe Closing Ceremony will take place at 9:00 p.m. local time / 3:00 p.m. ET. at Stade de France, the site of many of Team Canada’s medals over the course of the Games.\n\nREAD: Paris puts on a show for Olympic Opening Ceremony\n\nCheck back with the Team Canada channels early Sunday morning to find out who will carry the Canadian flag! \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCaela Fenton\nMay 26, 2025\n\n\n\nAlexa Pepper\nMay 26, 2025\n\n\n\nHayley McGoldrick\nMay 24, 2025\n\n\nAthletics\n\nCameron Levins’ marathon debut was one to remember.

A long-awaited celebration for France and a high jump competition that felt like it would never end.\n\nWhat tied it all together on a frantic final day of Olympic track and field at the Stade de France was the most familiar sight of all: Americans on the medal stand, over and over again.\n\nSydney McLaughlin-Levrone and Gabby Thomas brought the curtain down on track by romping to a win in the women’s 4x400 relay Saturday for America’s 34th overall medal at the track and 14th gold. Thomas was part of the U.S. gold-medal win a night earlier in the 4x100 women’s relay.\n\nTurning the race into a laugher on laps 2 and 3, the 400-hurdles and 200-meter gold medalists helped the U.S. finish more than 4 seconds ahead of second place and only .1 second off the world record set by the USSR in 1988. \n\nThe winning time: 3 minutes, 15.27 seconds.\n\n“I think this generation of track and field is just on a different level,” said McLaughlin-Levrone, who now has four gold medals in four events (to go with six world-record runs) over her career. “Everything is improving, including us, including our technique, including how we prepare. I don’t think anything is impossible at this point.”\n\nIn another race involving a different sort of .1-second margin, American hurdle gold medalist Rai Benjamin edged out 200-meter champion Letsile Tebogo of Botswana in the men’s relay.\n\n“I calculated that run very well, to a ‘T,’” Benjamin said. “I have a really good, high track IQ on people and how they run and how to do a quick time, so I didn’t have to get out too hard. Let’s just save it up to come home.’”\n\nFittingly, the final day of a track meet full of close calls and surprises featured two more races decided by .01 seconds -- an 800-meter win by Kenya’s Emmanuel Wanyonyi and a 100-meter hurdles victory for American Masai Russell.\n\nRussell edged out Cyrena Samba-Mayela of France. A heartbreaker, maybe, but it marked the home country’s first and only medal of the track meet and brought as big a burst of cheers as anything on an evening where eight finals were held.\n\n“I want to celebrate with the French public because they supported me and pushed me throughout all these Olympic Games,” Samba-Mayela said. \n\nOver in the high-jump pit, there were moments where it looked like the gold wouldn’t be decided before Sunday’s closing ceremony. \n\nNew Zealand’s Hamish Kerr and America’s Shelby McEwen each missed three times at 2.38 meters, triggering a jump-off at the same height for the title. \n\nThey both missed, which started the bar moving down. McEwen missed. Then Kerr missed. Then McEwen missed again — the 11th straight between the two. \n\nFinally, Kerr cleared 2.34 meters, peeled himself off the mat, ran a big semicircle into the javelin landing zone — thankfully long out of service by that point — collapsed on his back and covered his face with his hands.\n\nIn one of the more memorable moments from the last Olympics, the top two jumpers had finished in a tie, agreed to share the gold medal and then hugged it out to celebrate. This time, there was an unprecedented $50,000 first prize on the line that chipped away at that beautiful Olympic spirit.\n\nWas the $50K on McEwen’s mind when he decided to go for the win, not the tie?\n\n“Most definitely,” he said. “I’ve got a family to feed. So of course it was.”\n\nMcEwen’s loss still helped the U.S. reach 34 medals - the most for any country at a non-boycotted Games since the early 20th century, when there were more events and fewer nations involved. \n\nThe 14 golds are the most in a non-boycotted Olympics since Bob Beamon and Tommie Smith led the U.S. to 15 wins in 1968.\n\nFor such a dominant performance, it felt only fitting that McLaughlin-Levrone had a role in the final act. \n\nThe 25-year-old, who owns the world’s fourth-fastest time in the 400 to go with her latest world record in hurdles, ran her leg in 47.71. That was .91 seconds faster than the next fastest woman in the field, Femke Bol, who took the Netherlands to silver.\n\nThat McLaughlin-Levrone lightly clipped feet with Thomas when they passed the baton between the second and third laps felt like a distant memory — long forgotten by the time the “Star-Spangled Banner” played for the last time in the last medal ceremony of the night.\n\nWith around 200 meters to go, “Gabby and Syd kind of started walking on the track and they had to pull them back,” said Shamier Little, who ran the opening leg. “We were kind of celebrating. Of course, anything can happen. \n\n“But it wasn’t going to happen.”\n\nIn a speedy men’s 800, Wanyonyi beat Canada’s Marco Arop by .01 seconds in a photo finish, finishing in 1:41.19, only .28 off the world record.\n\nAmerican Bryce Hoppel’s national record of 1:41.67 was only good for fourth.\n\nJakob Ingebrigtsen won the 5,000 meters in a relatively drama-free race after the much-hyped 1,500 four nights earlier against Britain’s Josh Kerr turned into a disappointing fourth -place finish.\n\nIngebrigtsen won in 13 minutes, 13.66 seconds to add this title to wins at the last two world championships.\n\nKenya’s Ronald Kwemoi finished second and Grant Fisher of the U.S. finished third.\n\nHaruka Kitguchi won Japan’s only medal of the meet — a gold one —with a season-best throw of 65.80 meters. She’s the first Japanese woman to win a medal in any throwing event at the Olympics. \n\n___\n\nAP Summer Olympics: https://apnews.com/hub/2024-paris-olympic-games\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCopyright 2025 The Associated Press.

(AP Photo/Vadim Ghirda)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCHICAGO (AP) — Dansby Swanson wore his wife’s jersey and a grin wide enough to stretch from Chicago to Paris after the U.S. women’s national team beat Brazil for the Olympic gold medal on Saturday.\n\nThe Cubs’ shortstop went from a bundle of nerves to unbridled joy as he watched alone on a couch in his basement. His wife, Mallory, scored the lone goal in a 1-0 win over Brazil to propel the Americans to their fifth gold medal.\n\n“Definitely let out some fist pumps and screams, got up off the couch and then right back into the same spot,” he said prior to the Cubs’ game against the crosstown White Sox.\n\nMallory Swanson scored in the 57th minute when she shot low past Brazilian goalkeeper Lorena after midfielder Korbin Albert found her with a long ball through two Brazilian defenders. Swanson yelled at teammate Sophia Smith to stay away from the ball, knowing she would be offsides. The Americans hung on and completed an undefeated run to their first gold since the 2012 London Games.\n\n“Just so happy for her,” Dansby Swanson said. “It’s hard to really put into words just how happy I am for her, and she’s able to enjoy this moment.”\n\nThat golden moment came on the heels of a knee injury just over a year ago. Mallory Swanson endured multiple knee surgeries and a lengthy recovery after being stretchered off the field during a friendly against Ireland in April 2023 in the run-up to the Women’s World Cup.\n\n\n\n\nAfter the U.S. beat Brazil, Dansby Swanson got a call from his wife and they spoke briefly. He wanted her to “go enjoy this incredible moment” and was “thankful” her parents and best friends were there to witness it.\n\nAs for why he wasn’t in Paris, Dansby Swanson said his wife told him not to ask for a few days off because of his responsibilities to the team. The Cubs were four games out of a wild card entering Saturday’s game.\n\nA two-time All-Star and two-time Gold Glove winner, Dansby Swanson knows what it’s like to win a sport’s top prize. He played on Atlanta’s 2021 World Series championship team. Swanson is in his second season with the Cubs after signing a $177 million, seven-year contract.\n\n“I just know what I see and what I feel,” he said. “Just seeing her teammates’ reactions to her and the leadership she brings is truly special. ... It’s been a journey that’s really hard to put into words. But I just couldn’t be more thankful for obviously how it’s turned out and obviously she has been able to handle the ups, the downs and everything in between.”\n\n___\n\nAP Olympics: https://apnews.com/hub/2024-paris-olympic-games\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCopyright 2025 The Associated Press.

Daniels has all the tools — good arm, quick release, smooth as a runner and smart in the pocket — but perhaps more significant are his off-field habits.\n\nHe’s a football junkie. He gets to the practice facility before most of his teammates. Maybe before all of his teammates. He’s not consumed by social media or clout chasing. By all accounts, he keeps a pretty low profile.\n\nBeing a quarterback isn’t just about throwing with anticipation and avoiding sacks. Being a quarterback is being the center of a football franchise’s universe.\n\nDaniels seems ready for all of it.\n\n"

He became the first Ethiopian winner of the Olympic men's marathon in 24 years.\n\nTola's victory was all the more sweet given he was not initially on the team, having been called up after Sisay Lemma withdrew due to a hamstring injury. Tola, 32, won the New York marathon last year in a course record.\n\nHe crossed the finish line cheered on by Haile Gebrselassie, Ethiopia's former double Olympic 10,000m champion, whom he has cited as one of his inspirations to become a marathon runner.\n\nAbdi and Kipruto were jostling with Ethiopia's Deresa Geleta for the next two steps on the podium but Geleta faded in the last two kilometres.\n\nAbdi, who began his career competing in the 5000 and 10,000 metres, finished in 2:06:47 with 33-year-old Kipruto posting a time of 2:07:00.\n\nKipruto had posted the fastest time in the world this year having won the Tokyo Marathon in March in a personal best of 2:02:16.\n\nHe dedicated his bronze medal to Kelvin Kiptum, who died in a car crash in February at the age of 24, having broken the marathon world record in Chicago last year.\n\nKipchoge, widely considered the greatest marathon runner of all time, failed to bag a third consecutive gold, defeated by the first ascent of the course that took athletes out to Versailles.\n\nHe had been among the frontrunners but that hill broke up the leading pack and proved too much for the 39-year-old, who was participating in his fifth Olympics.\n\n\"The first part of the race we were together, talking and trying to move together. But I don't know what happened, so I will go and see him,\" Kipruto said of Kipchoge after the finish.\n\nEthiopia's Kenenisa Bekele, who has the fifth fastest marathon time ever, finished 39th.\n\n\"It was tough, you know, to challenge those guys,\" the 42-year-old said.\n\n- Reuters\n\nCopyright © 2024, Radio New Zealand\n\nKerr beat American Shelby McEwen in a tense duel in front of a packed house at the Stade de France.\n\nBritish diver Yasmin Harper is joining Nyjah Huston in pointing out a problem with the Paris bronzes.\n\nDikec may have gone viral for his calm and casual demeanour at the Olympics - but what he was feeling inside was quite the opposite.\n\nAustralia's Rachael Gunn - aka Raygun - said knew she couldn't compete athletically with her rivals - so she had to be \"different and creative\".\n\n\"I am a woman like any woman,\" Khelif told a news conference after her gold medal which came after a sustained campaign against her on social media.\n\nfor ad-free news and current affairs\n\nOlympics 2024 RSS\n\nFollow RNZ News"

While Kenya’s Faith Kipyegon justified her hot favourite tag to win gold at the Stade de France, Hull was not far behind to pick up silver – the first Olympic medal of any colour over this distance won by an Australian woman. Read Nicole Jeffery’s report\n\nThere was to be no repeat of the Sydney 2000 heroics as the Stingers fell to an 11-9 defeat in the gold medal match against Spain. At La Défense Arena, Australia’s women threatened to stage a late comeback, but it never materialised and they were left with silver and their best placing in 24 years. “It’s not gold, but it’s a silver and we’re really damn proud of it,” said Bronte Halligan. Read Kieran Pender’s report\n\nAnna Meares, Australia’s chef de mission at these Games, addressed the trolling that breaking athlete Rachael Gunn has had to endure since she debuted in Paris on Friday. Gunn, known as Raygun, was subjected to online abuse after she was knocked out at the round-robin stage of the competition, without receiving a point from the judges. Meares got in her corner on Saturday, saying, “I absolutely love her courage. I love her character, and I feel very disappointed for her that she has come under the attack that she has.” Read Kieran Pender’s story\n\nAustralia’s best weightlifter, Eileen Cikamatana, teared up and spoke of her disappointment after narrowly missing out on a medal in the 81kg category. The Fiji-born, two-time Commonwealth Games gold medallist finished fourth at the South Paris Arena and afterwards paid tribute to her veteran coach, the 80-something Paul Coffa. “I owe my life to him.

The modern pentathlete was, instead, calmly articulating a series of grievances after finishing ninth in the grounds of the Château de Versailles. Choong’s sentiments were only intensified by a medal ceremony taking place on a screen within view of where he spoke.\n\nIn no particular order: Choong was upset his brother, Henry, could not compete for Slovakia at the Olympics despite switching national allegiance. He was angry about Team GB not selecting his girlfriend, Olivia Green, for the Games. And Choong is one of umpteen athletes angry about the upcoming removal of showjumping from this event, a process accelerated after a German coach punched a horse at the last Games. “A happy athlete is a good athlete,” said Choong.\n\nIn Tokyo three years ago, Choong claimed gold. His hopes this time were fatally undermined by a poor fencing performance on Thursday. Choong did win his swimming heat on the final day but knew he was making up the numbers.\n\n“I have not been particularly happy with the training environment since a couple of months ago,” he said. “I said after Tokyo that my goals were to be in Paris with my brother, which couldn’t happen because of political reasons; he never got his Slovakian passport in time. Also, my girlfriend. I wanted to have my family competing with me. That process was really disappointing. I didn’t quite understand the decision-making process. It has been difficult to work through that. It made my job a lot harder from a mental point of view.\n\n“I am going to have a couple of months away to clear my head. I need to find love for the sport again. I don’t want to end on a ninth, I am an Olympic champion and double world champion for a reason. I showed physically I got the preparation right, mentally I just wasn’t in the right head space to perform when it mattered a couple of days ago.”\n\nWith horses to be removed from modern pentathlon by the time Los Angeles and 2028 comes around, a ninja warrior-style obstacle course will take their place. The switch has been met with widespread scorn.\n\n“You have to accept it because ultimately we weren’t listened to,” Choong said. “If you keep banging your head against a brick wall, all you do is hurt your head. It was a disappointing process. We said all along the process wasn’t right, that there were some misdeeds in there and I think some of those might be coming to light.\n\n“I don’t think that affected my performance. If anything it made me want to go out and enjoy the riding. I am from the least horsey background you can think of, in south London. Riding was the last sport I picked up. I started when I was 15, I know I am not a perfect rider but I have grown to love it. In terms of having the most diverse sport here, you cannot replace working with a living animal. I am sure obstacles is a great sport on its own, I just wish they worked their own way into the Olympics rather than piggy-backing on to our sport.” Ouch.\n\nSign up to Olympic and Paralympic briefing\n\nOur daily email briefing will help you keep up with all the goings on at the Olympics and Paralympics \n\nafter newsletter promotion\n\nThere was more. “People say you are making modern pentathlon modern again but you can’t make that argument when sports like archery are still in the Olympics,” Choong said. “We will still have a sport called modern pentathlon but it is not the real one.”\n\nThe 29-year-old could make a bid to feature in Los Angeles but at this point that seems unlikely. Ahmed Elgendy took gold for Egypt with a world record points tally of 1,555. Silver went to Taishu Sato of Japan, with Italy’s Giorgio Malan claiming bronze.\n\nTeam GB have high hopes for modern pentathlon medal glory in the women’s event on Sunday. Kerenza Bryson topped the standings in her semi-final with 1,402 points. Kate French, the reigning Olympic champion, qualified in fifth, three points behind.\n\nThis is the archive of The Observer up until 21/04/2025.

I mean, they just told me when I was doing TV that it was, like, before I was born that it kind of started, which is wild,” Stewart said. “It just goes to show those that have really paved the way and to create USA Basketball and what it is now. Tons of appreciation for that and knowing that when you represent this jersey and wear USA across your chest the standard is high and there really is nothing higher.”\n\nAnd the team didn’t disappoint some notable onlookers, including Sue Bird, Dawn Staley, Kevin Durant and Vanessa Bryant and her children.\n\nAfter the business-like semifinal win in which the U.S. started strong and never took its foot off the gas, the Americans will face France for the title. The U.S. is trying to become the first team — in any sport — to win eight consecutive Olympic gold medals, breaking the tie with the U.S. men’s program that won seven in a row from 1936-68. \n\nThe U.S. was able to take control of the game in the first half allowing coach Cheryl Reeve the opportunity to play her starters limited minutes, give players on the bench more court time, so everyone will be fresh and mentally set for the gold medal game.\n\n\n\n\n“The group that’s going to be out there is going to be a little more ready and rested to be able to give everything they had,” Reeve said.\n\nA win Sunday would be a record sixth gold medal for Diana Taurasi. A game after not starting for the first time since the 2004 Olympics, the Americans’ most decorated Olympic basketball player didn’t enter the game until 2:08 remained in the third quarter with the U.S. up 63-40. She missed her two shots, playing just a little over 6 minutes.\n\nThe U.S. jumped out to an early lead on Australia, but only were up 20-16 after the opening quarter. The Americans put the game away in the second quarter, starting the period with a 12-0 run. The U.S. led 45-27 at the half.\n\nJackie Young added 14 points, Kahleah Copper 11 and A’ja WIlson 10 for the Americans.\n\nIsobel Borlase led Australia with 11, and Tess Madgen and Ezi Magbegor each had 10.\n\nThere was no shortage of WNBA players on the court.\n\nBut while the American team features 12 WNBA All-Stars who have won multiple MVPs, the Australia roster is full of complementary players in the league. The Opals, who started five current WNBA players, just didn’t have enough offensive firepower to compete with the U.S. juggernaut.\n\nIn the end, the U.S. once again denied the Australians a chance at a gold medal in what’s been a one-sided affair between the teams. The Opals have never beaten the U.S. in Olympic competition, losing in the gold medal game in 2000, ’04 and ’08. \n\n“We had to play a perfect game today. I always say you got to believe that you can” beat the U.S., Australia coach Sandy Brondello said. “But nine times out of 10, there’s one game where you maybe can get them on a bad day. And it wasn’t our best day here.”\n\nThe Australians also lost to the U.S. in the semifinals of the 1996 and 2012 Olympics.\n\n“America, they’re the goats for a reason, you know?” said Australian Lauren Jackson, who has played in five of those losses. “They are full of superstars and I mean you look at the name on every single jersey out there and they are the best players in the world for a reason. They’re incredible.”\n\nJackson played 5 minutes after sitting out the last two games and didn’t score. The 43-year-old Jackson hasn’t contributed much in this Olympics, but the fact she’s still playing is a near miracle itself after she retired due to injuries in 2016.\n\nJackson made a return for the Opals at the 2022 World Cup, helping the team earn bronze there. Now she’ll hope that the team can get one more win Sunday to medal — something the Australians have done in each of the four other Olympics she’s competed in.\n\nThe U.S. will be looking for another gold.\n\n“I’m so proud of us,” Reeve said. “You know, the evolution that we’ve made as a team. And I’m excited that we’ve got ... to the last stand, if you will, in this campaign. (Now) see if we can get the gold.”\n\n___\n\nAP Summer Olympics: https://apnews.com/hub/2024-paris-olympic-games\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCopyright 2025 The Associated Press. All Rights Reserved."

It is clear that EVERYONE at [USA Track & Field] is more concerned with relationships than winning.\n\nChris Coleman (right) struggles to hand the baton to US teammate Kenneth Bednarek.Credit: AP\n\n“No athlete should step on the track and run another relay until this program is changed from top to bottom.”\n\nBy the time Fred Kerley took the baton for the anchor lap, the US were in seventh place. They ended up being disqualified for the illegal pass.\n\n“It just didn’t happen,” Coleman said. “Maybe we could have put in some more work. I just think, in the moment, it didn’t happen.”\n\nThe men’s team has now gone 20 years without an Olympic medal in the event.\n\nInstead, Andre De Grasse put a bright mark on his otherwise disappointing Olympics by anchoring Canada to gold in a time of 37.50 seconds.\n\nIt was De Grasse’s first medal in Paris and the Canadians’ first in the one-lap relay since Donovan Bailey anchored them in 1996. South Africa finished second and Britain third.\n\n“We’ve been together since 2021, or 2019, even,” De Grasse said. “We all train in Florida. We always practise for this moment. We know what we’re capable of.”\n\nIn a previous interview last week with the Associated Press, Lewis suggested experts in the US should develop a relay manual and send it to every high school coach in the country.\n\n“The issue has always been politics, has always been drama, has always been deception,” Lewis said. “If they can eliminate those things, there’s no question they have the fastest team in the world.”\n\nMost of the problems over the years – and this week – have been towards the front. On Thursday, in qualifying, Coleman handed to Kerley with his right hand while grabbing Kerley’s arm with his left – an awkward exchange that didn’t prove costly.\n\nThis one did. The only US podium finish during its dry spell was a silver in 2012 that was later stripped due to doping.\n\n“At the end of the day, we knew what we could do,” said Kyree King, who ran the third leg. “We came out here, and we had the mindset of no risk, no reward, so we went out there and went big. It didn’t happen.”\n\nSha’Carri Richardson anchors the US to gold in the women’s 100m relay.Credit: AP\n\nHowever, there was redemption for US superstar Sha’Carri Richardson, who powered the Americans to victory in the women’s 4x100m relay for her first Olympic gold.\n\n “I was very comfortable with these ladies,” Richardson said of a foursome that includes her training partners, 100m bronze medallist Melissa Jefferson and Twanisha Terry, and 200m champion Gabby Thomas.\n\nRichardson received the baton from Thomas in third place.\n\nBy the halfway point of her leg, Richardson had overcome runners from Britain and Germany. She glanced to her right – and backwards — and gave a look of “you’re not catching me”, then took eight more steps.\n\nOn the ninth one, Richardson slammed her left foot on the ground over the finish line and let out a yell.\n\nA bad pass between Thomas and Terry in qualifying, which could have ruined their Olympics, became nothing but a distant memory. And Richardson, a few days later than some expected, is an Olympic champion.\n\nThe Americans won in 41.78 seconds, for a .07-second win over Britain, who struggled with two baton changes in the rain.\n\n“I just remember trusting Gabby and knowing that she’s going to put this thing in my hand no matter what,” Richardson said, “and to leave my best on the track.”\n\nWith AP\n\nFor Olympics news, results and expert analysis sent daily throughout the Games, sign up for our Sport newsletter.\n\nCopyright © 2025"

She opened her first attempt with a conservative 112kg, 9kg shy of her personal best in competition, to ensure that she gets on the scoreboard. The 21-year-old breathed a huge sigh of relief after she successfully completed the lift in one fluid movement. \n\nShe then increased to 115kg in her second attempt and matched Romanian Elena Loredana Toma's second attempt, an Olympic record. For Reeves' third and final snatch, she broke that record with a shaky 117kg snatch where she nearly stepped off the back of the platform.\n\nWatch NBC 4 free wherever you are\n\nIn Toma's third attempt, the six-time consecutive European champion failed to match Reeves' 117kg, leaving the Romanian in third. Ecuador's Angie Palacios Dájomes, the silver medalist at the 2023 World Championship who then bested Reeves' total by 2kg, was in second place with a 116kg snatch.\n\nThe gold was then all but Reeves' to lose. No other woman in the 71kg session could match her on the clean & jerk, if she's able to register her first attempt at 140kg.\n\nGet Tri-state area news delivered to your inbox with NBC New York's News Headlines newsletter.\n\nAnd she did.\n\nIt left her with an untouchable total of 257kg. She wouldn't even have to take her second and third attempts to win gold, but she did hit a flawless 150kg for her second attempt. Her third attempt at 150kg would have been another Olympic record but she couldn't get under the jerk.\n\nThe first-time Olympian is now an Olympic champion with the total of 262kg.\n\nMari Leivis Sanchez of Colombia took silver on Friday, while Palacios Dajomes earned the bronze.\n\nWATCH: Women's weightlifting 71kg session\n\nWeightlifters from China typically dominate the sport, but due to changes in the qualification process --- each country was allowed to send only three women and three men to Paris 2024, one for each weight class. The number of weight classes was also reduced from 14 to 10. \n\nChina's Liao Guifang, 2023 World Champion and weightlifting total world record holder (273kg), would have been Reeve's biggest threat to gold but she wasn't selected to join the team.\n\n\n\nReeves' parents own a CrossFit gym and she has been competing since she was young. She holds an impressive number of 15 American records in youth, junior and senior categories. \n\nShe's the 2023 World Cup gold medalist in the 71kg and fans are looking for her to soon break the world record in both the snatch (121kg) and clean & jerk (154kg). Reeves' personal competition best is 120kg for the snatch and 151kg for the clean & jerk.\n\nIf these numbers don't mean anything to you, just know that Reeves is incredibly strong. She can squat more than three times her body weight, according to the number revealed by NPR. That's 224kg, or nearly 500 pounds, and she's only getting stronger.\n\nShe has added 26kg to her total since the first Olympic qualifier, according to USA Weightlifting."

But the older ones bring a different level of maturity to the dance,\" she told CNBC.\n\nIn a sport where scores are based in part on both originality and creativity, she said she wanted to give the judges a unique take.\n\n\"My specialty is style and creativity, not dynamics or power moves like many other dancers,\" she said, adding that she has developed her own moves, sequences and her own way of moving.\n\nShe knew going into her performance that her unexpected style might not score nearly as high, but she hoped it would be widely received by fans. \n\n\"I don't know if it's going to be valued as much as some of the other criteria, but I hope people are still wowed by what I bring since it's something different,\" she said. \n\nFor first-time watchers, there’s a lot to understand about the elements of breaking. \n\nBeyond the dance form's unique culture and history stemming from Black and brown communities in the Bronx in the 1970s, there is no other event like it at the Olympics. Some have likened it to a mix of gymnastics and martial arts, but with music and improvisation. \n\n“This is also going to be the only sport where they’re going to incorporate other elements of hip-hop, because there’s going to be a DJ and there’s going to be a host, or an emcee,” said Ronnie Abaldonado, a breaker who is one of NBC’s commentators for the breaking competition. \n\nThe breakers won't know what songs or music they'll compete to.\n\nBreaking has its own judging structure — the Trivium judging system, which will allow judges to evaluate breakers on their technique, vocabulary or variety, execution, musicality and originality.\n\nBreaking itself is made up of four primary elements: Toprock, Power moves, Footwork and Freezes.\n\nWithin those elements are an infinite combination of moves that make up a dancer's routine. Routines are rehearsed, but dancers have to be careful not to be repetitive and keep the spontaneity and improvisational aspect of the performance at its core. And “biting,” or copying, a set of moves from an opponent can cost them.\n\nThe Olympic competition will begin in a round-robin phase, when groups of four breakers will face off against each other one by one. Only two will emerge from each round-robin group before the quarterfinals, semifinals and the final matchup to determine the champion by the end of the evening.\n\nThe b-girls began on Friday, with semifinals and medal rounds still to come.

He earlier won gold, of course, in that incredible 100-meter race, had to be wheeled off the track, though, after getting bronze in the 200-meter, later revealing he had a COVID diagnosis. Let's just start with, what do we know about how he's doing?\n\nChristine Brennan, USA Today:\n\nAmna, we believe he's doing OK. I mean, he's going to be fine.\n\nBut who would have ever thought that, after two straight COVID Olympics, Tokyo Summer Games three years ago, Beijing 2.5 years ago, the Winter Olympics, that we would be talking about COVID here in Paris, something that people did not expect?\n\nBut he did come to the stadium with a mask on. He then, of course, took it off and raced and he won the bronze medal, and then, of course, collapsed. And we all found out very quickly what had happened and what was transpiring with him and his medical condition. He did not then run in the U.S. men's 4×100 relay. You mentioned Sha'Carri Richardson leading the U.S. women to gold.\n\nThe U.S. men once again made a huge mistake. This seems to be a problem with the United States. The best sprinters in the world, the best men's sprinters in the world, and the U.S. has not won a medal in the 4×100 relay since the 2004 Athens Games, so 20 years now of mistakes, dropping the baton, not passing it within the time frame that they have to, just a comedy of errors.\n\nSo, without Noah Lyles, the U.S. men failed to win a medal in that relay, and Noah Lyles' Olympics is finished in obviously a very strange situation with the gold in the 100, as you said, but with that COVID diagnosis and certainly not performing as he had hoped in the 200.\n\nAmna Nawaz:\n\nBig hopes, meanwhile, for the U.S. women's basketball team, which beat Australia in the semifinals, will now play France in a gold medal game. What are their chances of winning an eighth straight gold medal?\n\nChristine Brennan:\n\nI think they're really good. I was there. I was at that game earlier today on the Australia-U.S. Game.\n\nI will say this. The French, they know how to cheer, and they're loud and they have a great time doing it. I was at the swimming venue with Leon Marchand winning his four gold medals and I don't think I have ever heard an arena so loud. So I think the U.S. has got — the women of their hands full in terms of the French crowd and having to fight that.\n\nBut the U.S. women should win this game on Sunday, but I do think it's going to be tough with that incredible home crowd of the French.\n\nAmna Nawaz:\n\nWhen you look, Christine, sort of more broadly, there have been some really outstanding female athletes for Team USA these Games, Katie Ledecky, the swimmer, Simone Biles, of course, the greatest gymnast of all time, Sha'Carri Richardson, you mentioned,.\n\nWhat do we know about their futures? Are we going to see them compete again?\n\nChristine Brennan:\n\nKatie Ledecky, yes. Simone Biles, maybe, Sha'Carri Richardson, I would think so, although she kind of just stared off at the journalists when we asked about that tonight at the stadium. Richardson is 24. Ledecky and Biles are 27. So Katie Ledecky would be 31 in L.A. Guaranteed, if she's healthy, she's competing at the L.A. Olympics.\n\nSimone Biles, she said, \"We will see.\" I think everyone, the allure of competing on home soil in Los Angeles is going to drive a lot of these athletes to stick around. And, of course, the U.S. women, as we are talking about here, have won 58 percent of U.S. medals.\n\nSo, once again, for the fourth straight Olympics, the U.S. women will win more medals than the U.S. men, which is, of course, a total result of Title IX.\n\nAmna Nawaz:\n\nWomen leading the way there.\n\nChristine, indulge me if you can for just a moment in my sport of choice, field hockey, which we don't get to talk about a lot here. But not only did the Dutch men's team take gold in an incredible, dramatic game that came down to a penalty shoot-out. The Dutch women's team today also took gold in another penalty shoot-out.\n\nI just want to ask, you must be seeing a sea of orange-clad supporters cheering for them. Is that what you're saying in Paris?\n\nChristine Brennan:\n\nAlong the Champs Elysees, I have seen a lot of orange. And I was wondering why until I realized what the Dutch were doing. They're great. I mean, they celebrate, obviously, as any nation does, a smaller nation, right?\n\nAnd field hockey, a sport I played in high school as well, different sport now, but absolutely. For a nation to do that and win both, that's extraordinary. And when those countries, as you know — U.S. wins a lot of medals. China wins a lot of medals. But for some of these nations, there's one or two, three golds is their entire Olympics, which makes it all the more fun.\n\nAnd I bet you, if I opened my window, I'd hear them screaming out there right now in Paris in late evening after midnight.\n\nAmna Nawaz:\n\nChristine, in the minute or so we have left, are there any big surprises, things that have stood out to you from these Games?\n\nChristine Brennan:\n\nYou know, I think beach volleyball, which I think most Americans associate with the women's team especially as winning the gold, both of our U.S. teams did not make it to the medals.\n\nAnd so that surprised me. I was there watching that, especially a sport that is now an NCAA sport. And then Americans have come to realize and know that the U.S. women are terrific in it. So, shut out there, I think that's a surprise. And Simone Biles, as great as she was, with all of her wonderful performances, not being able to medal, falling off the balance beam, and then not winning the gold in the floor exercise.\n\nAgain, a terrific Olympics for Simone Biles, but a little bit of disappointment on that final day.\n\nAmna Nawaz:\n\nChristine Brennan of USA Today joining us once again from Paris covering these Olympic Games.\n\nChristine, always great to speak with you.

In the men’s gold-medal table tennis match, above, China’s Fan Zhendong scores on Sweden’s Truls Moregardh with a quick shot to the corner. Below, we revisit some of the most visually stunning scenes captured by New York Times journalists, frame by frame.\n\nIn their final round of the men’s synchronized 10-meter platform, the three-time world champions Lian Junjie and Yang Hao of China executed a dive with four-and-a-half somersaults. It scored over 100 points, a rare feat in the sport, and sealed their gold-medal victory.\n\nPhotographs and composite image by Weiyi Cai\n\nIn the quarterfinals of men’s basketball, LeBron James turned in a well-rounded performance, scoring 12 points along with 9 assists. He is shown here hitting his classic turn-around fadeaway jump shot from the post, as the United States beat Brazil, 122-87, to advance to the semifinal round against Serbia.\n\nPhotographs and composite image by Bedel Saget\n\nJanja Garnbret of Slovenia, the gold medalist at the Tokyo Games, placed first in the semifinals of women’s boulder and lead — the combined sport-climbing event. For her lead segment, shown here, she climbed nearly to the top of the 15-meter route, earning 96.1 points out of a possible 100.\n\nPhotographs and composite image by Weiyi Cai\n\nAlice D’Amato of Italy scored 14.366 points to win a surprise gold medal in the women’s balance beam final. Her leaps during the routine, shown below, were about three feet above the beam. Four gymnasts fell during their routines, including Simone Biles and Sunisa Lee of the United States, who were both expected to medal in the event, but ultimately did not make the podium.\n\nPhotographs by Bedel Saget; composite image by Jeremy White\n\nIn the jumping discipline of the equestrian competition, riders and their horses are timed as they leap over a series of obstacles. At the grounds of the Palace of Versailles, every obstacle is themed with French cultural references, from the Eiffel Tower to the Little Prince. The last obstacle is a bit different, though: It is dedicated to the next Summer Olympics, which will take place in Los Angeles in 2028. Here, the silver medalist, Steve Guerdat of Switzerland, and his horse, Dynamix de Belheme, are clearing that final jump.\n\nPhotographs and composite image by Weiyi Cai\n\nThe lavish Grand Palais played host to fencing when the Games began and has since transformed into the taekwondo venue. Athletes were introduced atop one of its grand staircases and descended to battle in the Nave, with its majestic glass ceiling. In this bronze-medal match, in the women’s 49-kilogram class, Lena Stojkovic of Croatia beat Merve Dincel Kavurat of Turkey, 2-0.\n\nPhotographs and composite image by Joe Ward\n\nCoco Yoshizawa, the Japanese 14-year-old, lands her last trick of the women’s street skateboarding final to cap her gold-medal performance. She followed her brother into the sport at age 7 and won bronze earlier this year at the World Skateboarding Tour Dubai.\n\nPhotographs and composite image by Jeremy White\n\nSonja Greinacher of Germany celebrates with her teammates after their gold-medal win in 3-on-3 basketball. Germany defeated Spain after Greinacher hit a 2-point shot with 30 seconds left to secure a 17-16 win.\n\nPhotographs and composite image by Jeremy White\n\nThe beach volleyball athletes played in front of a steady stream of enthusiastic sellout crowds in the shadow of Paris’s most famous landmark. In the women’s quarterfinals, shown here, the Australian team of Mariafe Artacho del Solar and Taliqua Clancy defeated Switzerland’s Zoe Verge-Depre and Esmee Bobner, 21-19, 16-21, 15-12, on Aug. 6.\n\nPhotographs and composite image by Joe Ward\n\nNote: The Times measured vertical distance from the balance beam on site in Paris and calibrated the grid shown in the graphic from the same position in which photos were taken.\n\nAdditional work by Jon Huang.\n\nAdvertisement"

WADA said two were low-ranking runners while another athlete had a higher profile. WADA said it declined to pursue an appeal because the athletes were already retired by the time they learned of USADA’s practice in 2021, at which point it told USADA to stop.\n\nWADA said the higher-profile athlete’s case “was never published, results never disqualified, prize money never returned, and no suspension ever served.”\n\nUSADA defended its handling of past cases and said it wants to keep using confidential informants. USADA said WADA knew of this approach before 2021 and is bringing it up now as a “smear” attempt in response to the recent Chinese doping controversy.\n\n“It’s an effective way to get at these bigger, systemic problems,” USADA chief Travis Tygart said. “If you’ve got agents or others who are preying on athletes and trafficking… I think it’s totally appropriate.”\n\nThe global anti-doping code gives leeway for suspensions to be reduced if athletes “substantially” assist with a doping investigation. But WADA believes athletes should not continue competing without first being prosecuted and sanctioned publicly.\n\nWADA argued that USADA’s tactic “can be used to justify a failure to prosecute a case for years while doped athletes are sent back into the field as undercover informants to compete against clean athletes.”\n\nThe two anti-doping agencies have been embroiled in a war of words ever since news broke earlier this year that 23 Chinese swimmers were cleared of positive doping tests in 2021 due to environmental contamination from their hotel kitchen.\n\nA Swiss prosecutor appointed by WADA to review the global anti-doping authority’s handling of the case found that WADA made an “indisputably reasonable” decision not to challenge the contamination conclusion reached by Chinese authorities. But American law enforcement is also examining the Chinese doping controversy under the Rodchenkov Act, which was passed in 2020 to extend U.S. jurisdiction to international sporting competitions featuring American athletes or financial connections.\n\nLast week, the International Olympic Committee (IOC) inserted a clause into Salt Lake City’s host contract for the 2034 Winter Olympics that allows IOC the right to withdraw the Games if the “supreme authority” of WADA “is not fully respected.” WADA also said last week that it would take USADA to its Independent Compliance Review Committee this month over the Rodchenkov Act, another move that could threaten American hosting plans for Los Angeles 2028 and Salt Lake City 2034.\n\nRelated: One Strike, You’re Out: Michael Phelps Calls for Lifetime Ban for Anyone Caught Doping\n\n\n\nΔ\n\n\n\nΔ\n\nIt’s ludicrous that athletes that are found to have been doping are not suspended or banned, but allowed to compete on the basis of exposing others.\n\nIs this quid pro quo even legal? Who are these athletes and have they qualified or won competitions?\n\nThis is a common practice in the United States.\n\nYou mean the doping.\n\nIt’s not an indictment on countries or organizations but sadly one on people. There are good and bad people everywhere.\n\nTeam USA also allowed an artistic swimming athlete to compete at Paris who got caught doping prior to Paris. She has a funny reason though. https://www.usada.org/wp-content/uploads/Calista-Liu-Consent-Award.pdf\n\nI think she was an alternate tho\n\nand that makes it ok???\n\nThat really doesn’t matter. She was still caught doping, and was cleared for the dumbest of reasons. She still competed for the us flag no?\n\nConfidential informants? No. You’re not the FBI. I’m usually not a fan of WADA and have been supportive of USADA but knowing this changes everything. Who the hell do they think they are? \n\nThis is bad.\n\nLets be blunt. If we heard this about China we would be asking for a ban. Why not now?\n\nNot really surprised USADA has rats. It’s usually the ones making the biggest fuss that have something to hide.\n\nWe just need to clean house on all of these doping governing bodies and cease international competition until athletes and testing agents agree on better leaders of these agencies (it shouldnt be long so dont jump on the keyboard angrily about the international competition comment)\n\nI bet Katie Ledecky and Michael Phelps are some of those doped athletes.\n\nyou are uniformed.

He has also demonstrated superb anticipation and is comfortable playing out from the back off both feet. I am delighted he has decided to join us.\n\n“Alex has really bought into the style of football we as a club want to play and he is a terrific result of how Kiwi footballers are putting their best foot forward on the world stage.”\n\nIt has been a whirlwind off-season for Paulsen, who not only recognised his dream with a Premier League move but also won the OFC Nations Cup with the All Whites and represented New Zealand at the Olympic Games in Paris.\n\nA post shared by A-Leagues (@aleagues)\n\nHaving recently returned home, the rising star goalkeeper will link up with his new teammates ahead of their pre-season trip to Sydney.\n\n“Auckland is my home, and I haven’t had many opportunities to play in my city and in front of my friends and family. I’m really excited by the opportunity to return to my hometown and continue to develop as a player,” said Paulsen.\n\n“There is so much excitement around the club and what we’re building here. I’ve only been home for a few days and I’ve seen people walking around in the new home strip and you can feel the energy around the club and the city.”\n\nPaulsen’s arrival at Auckland FC looks set to ignite the burgeoning A-Leagues rivalry that is emerging in New Zealand.\n\nThe Black Knights and Wellington Phoenix will meet for the first time in Round 3, with Sky Stadium hosting the blockbuster clash on November 2.\n\nPaulsen’s participation in the Isuzu UTE A-League is subject to approval of amendments to the A-Leagues Player Contract Regulations by Football Australia.\n\nA post shared by A-Leagues (@aleagues)\n\n© 2025 Australian Professional Leagues Company Pty Ltd ACN 646 799 199. *Live odds displayed are subject to change.\n\nSign up today to unlock it and access more exclusive content:\n\nIn-game, A-Leagues Match Highlights\n\nAccess to local and global football news\n\nPacked with opinions from our expert panel including Tom Smithies and more"

His combined points total for Team USA heading into the semi-final against Serbia on Friday was 29.\n\nIt was only a matter of time before Curry went off - at least that's what all the talking heads were saying.\n\nDAY 13 WRAP: Tears as Stingers win, Aussie boxers record 84-year first\n\nREAD MORE: Lyles taken from track in wheelchair after stunning defeat\n\nREAD MORE: How water quality concerns helped Aussie win marathon silver\n\nYet the four-time champion proved them right just when the team needed it.\n\nCurry scored 36 points, including a go-ahead 3-pointer with 2:16 left, paving the way for the US to advance to the gold medal match at the Paris Olympics after beating Serbia 95-91.\n\nJames and Stephen Curry embrace. Getty\n\nCurry shot 12-of-19 from the field and 9-of-14 from 3-point range and his 36 points fell one point shy of a USA Basketball Olympic record set by Carmelo Anthony.\n\n\"Steph? Man, that was a godlike performance,\" Kevin Durant said. \"That was tough. It felt like he was struggling throughout the whole tournament. We always said: Each night it'll be somebody different. Tonight, he showed up in a way that, man, God was with him tonight. He was with us tonight, through Steph.\"\n\nThe US trailed by 17 points in the first half, plus faced an 11-point halftime deficit — the biggest one successfully overcome by an American team since NBA players were added to the Olympic mix in 1992.\n\nCurry scored 17 of his 20 points in the first quarter with 14 of the 17 coming in less than four minutes. But somehow the US found themselves behind.\n\nWatch every moment, every medal of the Olympic Games Paris 2024 live and free on Channel 9 and 9Now. Plus, every event streaming ad free, live and on demand with 4K on Stan Sport.\n\nA barrage of Serbian 3-pointers had the Americans squarely on the ropes, until the game changed in the fourth.\n\nSerbia led by 11 with 7:19 left. But the US scored six points in two seconds. And just like that, against what looked like overwhelming odds, the US Olympic men's basketball team was on its way.\n\n Durant lands a three and one in a game-changing sequence. Getty\n\nThe whole game changed in the fourth after a wild sequence saw the U.S. score six points in two seconds. Kevin Durant made a three-pointer while Anthony Davis was getting fouled. The U.S. got another possession, and off the inbounds Devin Booker made another three-pointer.\n\nJust like that, a 78-67 lead for Serbia was down to 78-73. The comeback was on, and Curry's 3 put the US up for good. He added a pair of free throws with 8.2 seconds left to make it a two-possession game and the Americans escaped.\n\nJoel Embiid scored 19 points and LeBron James added 16 for the US, which is now assured of its 20th medal in 20 Olympic appearances.\n\nBogdan Bogdanovic scored 20 points for Serbia, which got 17 from Nikola Jokic and 15 from Aleksa Avramovic.\n\n\"I still believe that we could have won this game, a couple of possessions, a call goes our way, a couple of shots,\" Serbia's Bogdanovic said. \"But that is basketball. You should be proud even if you lose a game like this.\"\n\nSerbia coach Svetislav Petic kept saying the same thing all summer, that the team the US put together for the Paris Games was better than any in Olympic history. Even the Dream Team, he insisted.\n\nRelief for Team USA Getty\n\n James and Durant will play for a gold medal. AP\n\n The US improved to 144-6 all-time in Olympic play, 63-4 since NBA players were added to the Olympics in 1992.\n\nThe comeback kept Kevin Durant’s hopes of becoming the first four-time Olympic men’s gold medallist very much alive,\n\nAnd of all the US semi final moments, this was like few others. The four-point final margin was the second closest in American history in the Olympic semi-finals; the US beat Lithuania by two in the 2000 semi-finals in Sydney, on the way to gold there.\n\nIt’ll be the US against host France for gold in a dream matchup for the host nation on Saturday night, while Serbia will face Germany for bronze.\n\n28 minutes ago\n\n60 minutes ago\n\n2 hours ago\n\n© 2025 Nine Entertainment Co."

Grant Holloway won that elusive Olympic gold medal. Jasmine Moore made some American jumping history. And Tara Davis-Woodhall got to wear that cowboy hat.\n\nIt was medal-mania at the Stade de France for the red, white and blue on Thursday, with the country taking home three gold, three silver and two bronze. \n\nOn a night when Noah Lyles revealed he tested positive for COVID-19 — and still captured bronze in the 200 — nearly every other American contender was celebrating medals. So much so, that they were running into each other during their victory laps. \n\nMaybe the best scene came when McLaughlin-Levrone, wearing a tiara, met up with the cowboy-hat donning Davis-Woodhall, who had won the long jump competition.\n\n“I was like, ‘You did it.’ And she was like, ‘YOU did it,’” Davis-Woodhall recounted. “And I was like, ‘Oh my god, I did it’. ... Is this real? Am I dreaming?”\n\nThat was a common theme on the evening. Moore, who finished third in the long jump, was the first American woman to qualify for the same Olympics in both the long jump and triple jump. Now, she’s the first American woman to win bronze in both.\n\n“I don’t think I pictured this for myself, and it’s way better than I could have imagined,” Moore said. “It makes you want to work even harder because you know what it feels like (winning a medal).”\n\n\n\n\nHolloway knows the feeling. He’s been so dominant in the 110-mter hurdles, winning three straight world titles. But Olympic gold has eluded him — until Thursday. He and Daniel Roberts finished 1-2. \n\n“Today, it was just my day,” said Holloway, who earned silver at the Tokyo Games. “I have the Olympic title, I have the world titles, indoor titles. We just put a lot of whipped cream on it and now we are just going to keep rolling, rolling, rolling until that very last race and put the cherry on it.”\n\nKenny Bednarek and Lyles started the medal parade by finishing second and third, respectively, in the 200. Lyles, the 100 champion, didn’t look like his speedy self and revealed after the race he tested positive two days ago. He had woken up in the middle of the night with chills and a sore throat.\n\n“It definitely affected my performance,” Lyles said. “I’m more proud of myself more than anything, coming out here to get a bronze with Covid.”\n\nIt was another big performance by McLaughlin-Levrone, who broke the 400-meter hurdles record for the sixth time. She had company on the podium in silver-medalist Anna Cockrell.\n\nThe night was reason to belt out a tune.\n\n“I was singing ‘Love On Top’ in the call room, so shout out to Beyoncé,” Cockrell said. “I’m really happy. I’m ugly crying, but I’m really happy.”\n\n___\n\nAP Summer Olympics: https://apnews.com/hub/2024-paris-olympic-games\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCopyright 2025 The Associated Press. All Rights Reserved."

Yes, that’s the same player who got a tryout with the Green Bay Packers back in rookie minicamp.\n\nThe Jamaican athlete threw the discus 70 meters in Paris, marking his career personal best mark and an Olympic record. He’s also going to be remembered in history as the first Jamaican to ever win Olympic gold in the event for his home country.\n\nStona originally attended Clemson as a track and field athlete before transferring to Arkansas. After his college career was done, Stona began training for a potential conversion into football, which included him meeting with NFL teams at Arkansas’ pro day. Ultimately, he earned rookie minicamp tryout opportunities with both the Packers and New Orleans Saints this spring. In the same month that he attended both minicamps, though, he was still competing in the discus throw at the LA Grand Prix. Two months later, he officially made the Olympic cut.\n\n Jamaica's Roje Stona takes the Discus Lead-70.00m for new OR!This Discus comp is NUTS!video: @MTCthrowers pic.twitter.com/F4FL5JuyWS\n\nWhether or not the 6’7”, 263-pounder will return to football, a sport he never played until he reached the professional level, has yet to be determined. Certainly, NFL teams seem interested enough, as long as he’s going to focus on the sport. With Olympic gold under his belt now, it’s going to be tough for Stona to just ignore the success he’s had in athletics, though.\n\nEither way, it’s nice to see a (technically) former Packer doing big things.\n\nGambling Problem?

She ran over to the Olympic crowd and took another three swings at the air.\n\nAussies in the stands flew the flag, shook green-and-gold banners and held up yellow inflatable kangaroos.\n\nKennedy didn’t know at that stage she would deliver Australia an 18th gold medal at the Paris Games — a national record for the Olympics. That was just the celebration for clearing the height to take the lead.\n\nKennedy clinched the victory a bit later Wednesday when Tokyo Olympic gold medalist Katie Moon failed to clear 4.95 meters after a three-hour final.\n\nThen the emotions took over. Kennedy raced back to her supporters in the crowd and the tears flowed as she hugged friends, family and discus throw bronze medalist Matthew Denny, who just happened to be walking back after his final to join the group. Then Kennedy sprang back across the track, hopping with delight.\n\nA man in the crowd yelled: “What did you just do?”\n\nWell, delivering Australia’s fourth gold medal on Day 12 helped surpass the country’s previous record total of 17 golds for a Summer Games — set at the 2004 Athens Olympics and in Tokyo three years ago. The Australians moved from 14 to 18 gold medals in about six hours, while most of the country Down Under was sleeping.\n\n“I didn’t know that, that is just insane,” Kennedy said after being told of the record haul. “I can’t wait to go home and watch a replay of the whole Olympics.”\n\n\n\n\nIt was a good day — no need to abbreviate g’day for this feat — as Aussies woke up to news of the record. The productive stretch had Australia ranked third in the gold-medal standings behind the United States and China with four days of the Paris Games remaining. Australia had 18 gold, 12 silver and 11 bronze for a total of 41 medals, still well short of the record 58 it won at home at the 2000 Sydney Games.\n\nBrisbane, Australia, is in line after the 2028 Los Angeles Olympics to host the Summer Games in eight years. The starter’s gun has gone off.\n\nThe Australian team’s other golds on Wednesday included a first in two decades for the men’s team pursuit cycling team, which edged rival Britain at the Vélodrome National de Saint-Quentin-en-Yvelines. Sailor Matt Wearn successfully defended the men’s dinghy title and skateborder Keegan Palmer made it back-to-back Olympic golds.\n\nIt was slightly overwhelming for the 21-year-old Palmer, with skateboarding great Tony Hawk praising his work and Snoop Dogg in the bowl.\n\n“It’s an absolute honor, you know, just being able to be a part of that crew that was able to beat the record for us, with 18, it really doesn’t get much better,” Palmer, who grew up on Australia’s Gold Coast, an hour down the road from Brisbane, said in a night-time interview. “Australia is where I learned how to walk, talk, skate, surf, do everything I know how to do.\n\n“So that’s why I also represent Australia, because that’s where it all went down for me. They deserve to have a gold medal come back for the stuff they’ve given me.”\n\n___\n\nAP Olympics: https://apnews.com/hub/2024-paris-olympic-games\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCopyright 2025 The Associated Press.

Read our Privacy notice\n\nLin Yu-ting, one of the fighters thrust into a gender eligibility row at the Olympics, reached the women’s featherweight final before her beaten opponent made an ‘X’ sign with her fingers.\n\nTurkey’s Esra Yildiz Kahraman lost every round on the judges’ scorecards against Chinese Taipei fighter Lin, who joined Algeria middleweight Imane Khelif in reaching a gold medal match at Paris 2024.\n\nAfter a friendly handshake, Kahraman held the ropes open for her opponent as she exited but then went to the centre of the ring and made an ‘X’ symbol with her two fingers to all areas of the crowd.\n\nThe gesture is the same as what Lin’s last opponent Svetlana Staneva did following her points loss to the top seed but when asked to explain the signal, one of Kahraman’s team replied: “No comment.”\n\nShe added: “I am sad I didn’t go further and get to the final. But I will carry on to 2028 (Los Angeles Olympic Games) where I want to become the champion.”\n\nThe participation of Lin and Khelif at these Games has been under the microscope since it emerged both were disqualified from last year’s World Championships for failing to meet gender eligibility criteria.\n\nThose championships were held under the auspices of the International Boxing Association, which has failed to provide any proof of its findings and was expelled last year by the International Olympic Committee over financial and corruption concerns.\n\nWhile the two boxers have been allowed to return to competition by the IOC, which is administering the sport at these Games, the scrutiny intensified when Khelif beat Angela Carini of Italy in just 46 seconds in her opening bout last Thursday.\n\nOne day after Khelif booked her spot in the 66kg final with victory over Thailand’s Janjaem Suwannapheng, Lin did likewise in the 57kg category and the pair are now each just one win away from being crowned Olympic champions.\n\nBoth fighters were cheered to the ring at Phillippe-Chatrier Court at Roland Garros before touching gloves ahead of the first round, where Lin showed superior speed and timing to beat Kahraman to the punch.\n\nKahraman was more physical and at one point she pushed her taller and rangier opponent to the floor as she looked to close the distance but the cleaner and more effective work came from Lin and was recognised by the judges.\n\nIn Saturday’s showpiece, Lin will now take on Polish 20-year-old Julia Szeremeta, who defeated Tokyo 2020 silver medallist Nesthy Petecio of the Philippines in the other semi-final.\n\nLin said: “I am one fight closer to my goal of the gold medal. I really enjoyed that fight. Every athlete here is among the best in the world, so I will have to do my best to prepare for the final.\n\n“After going out in the first round of the Tokyo Olympics, it’s been a tough journey to reach the finals. I will use everything I’ve learned in my life to do my best in the next match.”\n\nPlease refresh the page or navigate to another page on the site to be automatically logged inPlease refresh your browser to be logged in"

To me it is suspect.' \n\nDutch lawyer Stephan Wensing refused to divulge his female client's identity when he released the video to the world earlier in the week. It is unknown if she is also from the Netherlands, which has always been a strong rival of Team GB in equestrian sports.\n\nYet yesterday Team NL swiftly batted away any suggestion that the leak of Dujardin, who had hoped to become Britain's most decorated female Olympian this year, had come from them insisting that they 'only just saw the video after it was published'.\n\nThe video in question shows the dressage star allegedly lashing a horse at stables in Gloucestershire was made public by a Dutch lawyer on behalf of an anonymous client, who filmed it several years ago but has chosen to release it only now.\n\nFootage showed Charlotte Dujardin seemingly hitting a horse repeatedly with a whip across the legs\n\nDujardin has withdrawn from the Paris Games over a video showing her making an 'error of judgement'\n\nDujardin (pictured at the Olympic Games in 2012) was hoping to become Britain's most decorated Olympian but was forced to pull out of the games on Monday\n\nThe timing of the complaint has raised suspicions with CEO of British Dressage Jason Brautigam stating the grievance was 'timed to cause maximum damage' before urging people to 'kind' to the fallen athlete\n\nDujardin declared that she was 'deeply ashamed' by her behaviour as she bid farewell to her chance to become Britain's most decorated female Olympian. \n\nMs Dujardin narrowly defeated Team NL at the Tokyo Olympics in 2021, and they were due to clash again next Tuesday at the Palace of Versailles.\n\nA spokesperson for the Netherlands team said they 'regret the expulsion of our fellow athlete' but 'also condemn the training method used by Dujardin in the video', adding: 'This has no place in our equestrian sports where the welfare of the horse comes first. \n\n'We are aware the video was released by a Dutch lawyer but would like to emphasise that the origin and the release has got no relation whatsoever to the Dutch Olympic team. We only just saw the video after it was published.'\n\nMs Dujardin was shown the video by the sport's governing body, who had been sent it by the female whistleblower. \n\nMr Wensing said: 'It's not fun to ruin a career. [My client] is not celebrating; she doesn't feel like a hero. But she told me this had to be done as she wants to save dressage.' \n\nReacting to the news last night, Mr Brautigam, who heads up the UK's organisation for dressage, said the last few days had been 'an extremely upsetting time for everyone involved in the sport', adding that the community had been 'let down'.\n\n'Let me be clear: the actions we have witnessed in that video are completely unacceptable. We have all been shocked and appalled by this indefensible conduct,' he said in an email to members. \n\nCharlotte Dujardin with her Tokyo 2020 Olympic winning horse Gio (left) and former Olympic gold medal winner Valegro (right) in 2021. She has since been suspended following a horse whipping scandal \n\n\n\n'As I have always said, the horse is at the heart of everything we do in British Dressage, and equine welfare must always be paramount above all other considerations.' \n\nThe chief of British Dressage rejected claims that the group had seen the video prior to its public release this week, adding that it supports all whistleblowers.\n\nYet Mr Brautigam also asked his members to take a sympathetic approach to Dujardin, reminding each member they have a 'duty of care' to one another.\n\n'Charlotte Dujardin has done the right thing by accepting responsibility and expressing remorse,' he added. \n\n'While we do not condone her behaviour, we must remember that there is also a human element to this – and, regardless of what has happened, she still deserves our understanding. \n\n'Please be kind and bear in mind that we have a duty of care in our interactions with one another.'\n\nHe went on to probe the motives behind the complaint.\n\n'I do find claims that this was done to 'save dressage' somewhat disingenuous, given that it was timed to cause maximum damage to our sport,' he added.\n\n'However, what will save dressage is how we all respond to this crisis by demonstrating our love and care for horses.'\n\nAs well as being given a six-month provisional ban, Ms Dujardin was dumped by at least three of her sponsors – riding helmet brand Charles Owen, insurance company KBIS and Danish equestrian equipment company Equine LTS.\n\nUK Sport has suspended her Lottery funding, and Brooke, the world's largest horse welfare charity, axed her as its ambassador, saying: 'Our whole ethos is around kindness and compassion to horses and to see the opposite of this from someone with such a high profile is beyond disappointing.'\n\nMs Dujardin would have been a shoo-in for a damehood if she had picked up a medal in Paris, which was all she needed to become Britain's most successful female Olympian ever. \n\nFootage resurfaced of Dujardin showing how to 'correctly' whip a horse (pictured is a grab from the video)\n\nDujardin with her fiancé Dean Wyatt-Golding after winning the gold medal at the Dressage in the 2016 Rio Olympics\n\nBut Whitehall sources have disclosed that any such honour is now off the table. She also faces being stripped of the CBE she was awarded in 2017. \n\nThe honours committee will await the result of the probe by the International Federation for Equestrian Sports (FEI) before deciding.\n\nThe video shows Ms Dujardin lashing a horse as it was trained in how to perform a 'piaffe', a form of slow trot. Mr Wensing likened it to a circus elephant being mistreated. \n\nIn a statement on Tuesday evening, Ms Dujardin apologised to her sponsors, fans and Team GB. \n\nShe said: 'A video has emerged from four years ago which shows me making an error of judgment during a coaching session.\n\n'What happened was completely out of character and does not reflect how I train my horses or coach my pupils. \n\n'However, there is no excuse. I am deeply ashamed and should have set a better example at that moment.'\n\nTeam GB yesterday revealed that Yorkshirewoman Becky Moody, riding her horse Jaegerbomb, will replace Ms Dujardin in the British dressage team at the Olympics.\n\nOn Thursday evening the CEO of British Dressage Jason Brautigam released a message to members. It read:\n\n'In the wake of the distressing news this week, I wanted to write to you all personally to share my views and reflections on what this means for us and the future for our sport.\n\n'First and foremost, my heart goes out to all of you as members. I am sure you have been feeling the same mix of emotions as myself and the rest of the team at British Dressage. It has been an extremely upsetting time for everyone involved in the sport and we are all feeling let down by these revelations.\n\n'Let me be clear: the actions we have witnessed in that video are completely unacceptable. We have all been shocked and appalled by this indefensible conduct. As I have always said, the horse is at the heart of everything we do in British Dressage, and equine welfare must always be paramount above all other considerations. As the National Governing Body for the sport of dressage in the UK, our primary aim is to uphold and promote the highest standards of horse care and well-being.\n\n'Our mission is to 'bring people and horses together in harmony' and a central part of this is promoting the correct methods for training horses. We have robust equine welfare policies in place to deal with such situations, including our Members' Code of Conduct and Charter for the Horse, and take a zero-tolerance approach to any breaches of our rules. While this has been an extremely difficult time for the BD team, the events of the last 72 hours prove that these policies do work.\n\n'Contrary to some reports, we did not receive any complaint or have any sight of the video prior to this week. Had that happened, we would have acted swiftly and decisively, just as we did on Monday. We always protect and support whistleblowers and would encourage anyone with evidence of equine abuse to come forward at the earliest opportunity.\n\n'We fully support the FEI in the actions they have taken in response to this incident and have reciprocated the provisional six-month suspension with immediate effect. The individual concerned will be subject to our own disciplinary processes, but we will not be making any further comment on the specifics until the FEI's investigations are complete.\n\n'Riders should always train horses with the objective of developing a happy, healthy athlete. This is achieved through harmonious education, by establishing a confident and secure partnership that is based on mutual respect, care, and understanding. Our equine welfare policies are very clear in promoting the guiding principles that underpin our sport. There is no justification for using training methods that are abusive, cause fear or inflict pain.\n\n'Last month marked my ten-year milestone as Chief Executive at British Dressage. I would not have spent a decade of my professional career in the sport if I thought it was in any way cruel or inflicted harm on horses. My priority is to protect the horse, but also to protect all of the riders out there who genuinely love their horses and have spent years developing a special and unique bond with their equine partners in a sensitive and empathetic way.\n\n'While we cannot collectively be held responsible for the actions of individuals behind closed doors, we can hold them to account when breaches of our rules and regulations come to light. We will be measured on how we now react to this situation. The sport of dressage is not defined by one person – and no one person is bigger than our sport.\n\n'We are all role models, and it is going to be incumbent on all of us to prove why dressage and the welfare of the horse actually go hand in hand. I do find claims that this was done to 'save dressage' somewhat disingenuous, given that it was timed to cause maximum damage to our sport. However, what will save dressage is how we all respond to this crisis by demonstrating our love and care for horses.\n\n'As this incident has highlighted, there is absolutely no room for complacency – and as Roly Owers from World Horse Welfare rightly said, it is a wake-up call for all of us. We will need to rebuild trust to gain public acceptance, which will inevitably take time and a concerted effort from everyone, whether riders, owners, coaches, officials, organisers, staff or volunteers. We all have a part to play in this and we all need to be ambassadors for our sport.\n\n'Charlotte Dujardin has done the right thing by accepting responsibility and expressing remorse. While we do not condone her behaviour, we must remember that there is also a human element to this – and, regardless of what has happened, she still deserves our understanding. Please be kind and bear in mind that we have a duty of care in our interactions with one another.\n\n'In the immediate future we need to rally our support around Carl, Lottie and Becky as they fly the flag for Team GB in Paris over the next ten days. It will be incredibly difficult for them to compete in such circumstances, but we need to show that we're right behind them all the way, as they aim to bring home medals and showcase the best of our sport.\n\n'As we proved during the pandemic, the dressage community pulls together in times of adversity. We will recover from this – and we can come back stronger and better as a result. So, while we are all hurting at the moment, please remember that we're all in this together.\n\n'We need to support each other, but most importantly be proud of the sport we all love. Please continue to hold your heads up high and hopefully we will be able to celebrate our team's success over the next two weeks.'\n\n\n\t    Share what you think\n          \n\nThe comments below have not been moderated.\n\n\n      The views expressed in the contents above are those of our users and do not necessarily reflect the views of MailOnline.\n    \n\nWe are no longer accepting comments on this article.\n\nPublished by Associated Newspapers Ltd\n\nPart of the Daily Mail, The Mail on Sunday & Metro Media Group"

        "expanded content": "\n\t\t\t\tSport\t\t\t\n\n\n \n\t\t\t\tBy Matt Craig \n\n\nWhile the Paris Olympics are sure to produce a new set of heroes, the 2024 Summer Games are not likely to mint many new millionaires. “Winning a medal helps with opportunities, but that also is a fairly short-lived thing, to be honest,” says Mikaela Shiffrin, a decorated alpine skier who won her first Winter Olympics gold in 2014. “The world moves on fairly quickly, so if you don’t continue to show success or value in the marketplace, then that excitement from the medal disappears.”\n\nEven in popular Olympic sports like gymnastics, swimming or track and field, there is little hope for big paydays directly through competition. While many countries pay bonuses to medal winners—in the United States, it’s $37,500 for gold, $22,500 for silver, $15,000 for bronze—a lack of major professional leagues and four years between Olympics means that athletes have to be smart about capitalizing on their newfound fame.\n\nSimone Biles, a rare returning Olympic champion who has crossed over into mainstream stardom, earned less than $100,000 directly from gymnastics in 2023, but away from the sport, she took home $7 million from endorsements, according to Forbes estimates. Badminton player P.V. Sindhu, a marketing star in her native India, had identical earnings splits, according to Forbes estimates. But endorsement earners of that caliber are rare outside major professional leagues.\n\nIf Forbes were ranking this summer’s highest-paid Olympians without breaking it down by sport, the list would be dominated by NBA players, professional golfers and tennis stars—athletes Forbes tracks throughout the year with large playing contracts or prize money winnings and millions of dollars in brand endorsements and business ventures off the field.\n\nNBA players are the highest-paid group of athletes in Paris by a wide margin, with Team USA alone containing seven of the 50 highest-paid athletes in the world across all sports (eight, before Kawhi Leonard bowed out with an injury). Still, there are 35 active NBA players across the other teams in the competition, and Canada’s 10 NBA players, for example, make an average on-court salary of $16.2 million. As a category, basketball players are the most consistent earners off the court, and all but LeBron James and Giannis Antetokounmpo make more money from their NBA salaries than from endorsements. James also has the distinction of being the only billionaire to compete at the 2024 Olympic Games.\n\nAmong female athletes, tennis players reign supreme in terms of earnings. Poland’s Iga Świątek, a five-time Grand Slam champion and the world’s No. 1 singles player at just 23 years old, already ranks ninth in the all-time WTA prize money rankings and has endorsements that include Rolex, Porsche, Visa and On shoes and apparel. Since winning her first Grand Slam at last year’s U.S. Open, world No. 2 Coco Gauff has added sponsorships from Ray-Ban and hair care brand Carol’s Daughter to an already robust portfolio. And 26-year-old Naomi Osaka, who will represent Japan at the Games, is hoping to reestablish her game on the court and reclaim her crown as the highest-paid female athlete in the world, a title she held for three straight years from 2020 to 2022.\n\nIn this month’s Wimbledon final, 21-year-old Carlos Alcaraz dominated 37-year-old Novak Djokovic for what felt like a long-awaited passing of the torch in tennis. The young Spaniard also won last month’s French Open title on the same courts where the Olympic tennis competition will be held. Considering the Grand Slam bonuses in his Nike deal and with the addition of Louis Vuitton to his sponsorship portfolio in early 2024, Alcaraz could also become the highest-paid tennis player in the world this year.\n\nNelly Korda has dominated the LPGA Tour this season, earning more than $3 million in prize money so far in 2024 and at one point winning five consecutive tournaments. The 25-year-old American was already golf’s top pitchwoman, with sponsors including Delta Air Lines, Goldman Sachs and T-Mobile. Both Brooke Henderson and Jin Young Ko are marketing stars in their home countries as well, each pulling in an estimated $3.5 million off the course.\n\nJon Rahm had the highest-earning year of any golfer Forbes has ever recorded, thanks to his defection to the LIV Golf tour that came with an estimated $175 million upfront payment from the Saudis, who own the breakaway golf tour. Scottie Scheffler and Rory McIlroy—the No. 1 and No. 2 golfers in the world—have remained loyal to the PGA Tour, and have each benefited from a bump in prize money in response to the LIV emergence.\n\nNotably absent from the USWNT roster in Paris are longtime stalwarts Alex Morgan and Megan Rapinoe, the two highest earners from last year’s Women’s World Cup. However, several players on Team USA now earn more than $1 million as salaries and endorsement opportunities have increased in recent years. The top spot is now reserved for La Reina, the queen of Spanish soccer in two-time Ballon d’Or Féminin winner Alexis Putellas, the first Spanish woman to win any world player of the year trophy. She has signed up more than 10 long-term endorsement deals.\n\nThe earnings published here are pulled from lists Forbes compiles throughout the year, and therefore have different reporting windows. The men’s basketball category comes from the Highest-Paid Athletes list, which tracked the 12-month window from May 2023 to May 2024. The women’s tennis and women’s golf categories are drawn from the Highest-Paid Female Athletes list, tracking calendar year 2023. The men’s tennis category is from our Highest-Paid Tennis Players list, published before the U.S. Open, and includes all earnings from September 2022 to September 2023. Men’s golf comes from our Highest-Paid Golfers list, tracking June 2023 to June 2024. And women’s soccer is based on our Highest-Paid Players At The Women’s World Cup, with a window of July 2022 to July 2023.\n\nAll of these lists are compiled through dozens of conversations with industry insiders, plus news reports and salary databases. On-field earnings include prize money, salaries and sport-related bonuses. Off-field earnings figures are an estimate of sponsorship deals, appearance fees and memorabilia and licensing income, as well as cash returns from any businesses in which the athlete has a significant interest.

But Aaron BROOKS (USA) had other plans. He defeated Taylor in the Olympic trials in the United States to book his spot at 86kg for the U.S.\n\nNow, Yazdani is the favorite to win the gold. He can also become the first Iran wrestler to win two Olympic golds.\n\nPARIS 2024 SCHEDULE | PARIS 2024 NEWS\n\nThe 86kg weight class on August 8 isn't the only one in which history can be created. Both the other two weight classes also have a chance to see some historic medals to be won.\n\nA post shared by Olympic Wrestling (@unitedworldwrestling)\n\nThe 57kg in Freestyle will have world champion Stevan MICIC (SRB) trying to win the first medal for Serbia in Freestyle at the Olympics. Zelimkhan ABAKAROV (ALB), also a world champion, has the same task for Albania.\n\nIn women's 57kg, Rio 2016 champion Helen MAROULIS (USA) has a chance to win the third Olympic medal for the U.S. while she tries to knock off world champion Tsugumi SAKURAI (JPN). Maroulis is no stranger to beating Japanese world champions at the Olympics.\n\nAnastasia NICHITA (MDA) has a great chance to make history for Moldova by winning a medal even as the bracket has Kexin HONG (CHN), ANSHU (IND), Odunayo ADEKUOROYE (NGR) and Alina HRUSHYNA (UKR) among others.\n\nFS 86kg: Over to Yazdani\n\nEver since his move to 86kg after winning the gold medal at 74kg in Rio, Yazdani has lost to only one wrestler -- Taylor. With the American not in Paris, Yazdani has his tail up.\n\nThroughout the 2023 season, Yazdani wrestled with a shoulder injury and it became a headache for Iran when he underwent surgery. Iran contemplated having a wrestle-off between Yazdani and 92kg world champion Kamran GHASEMPOUR (IRI). But then Brooks beat Taylor.\n\nHassan YAZDANI (IRI) trains in Mazandaran, Iran. (Photo: United World Wrestling / Jake Kirkman)\n\nYazdani won the Budapest Ranking Series and reignited his hopes of winning the gold.\n\n\"I thank God that I was able to get on the mat in international competitions after seven months and 13 days,\" Yazdani had said in Budapest. \"I had a little preparation and it was around 60 percent. I hadn’t wrestled for a long time. I have some weaknesses that I hope I can fix before the Olympics so that I can wrestle better than these competitions and get the gold medal. I hope that until the Olympics, I can eliminate my weaknesses so I can win the best medal for my country and our good people.\"\n\nYazdani was winning the Tokyo final when Taylor scored a takedown in the final moments to claim the gold. A furious Yazdani walked off the mat, hitting anything that came his way. But two months after that loss, he defeated Taylor at the Oslo World Championships, his only win over the American. Taylor would rebound to beat him at the 2022 and 2023 World Championships.\n\nBrooks, a four-time NCAA champion, defeated Taylor in a best-of-three series at the trials. Brooks has a U23 world title and is now the biggest threat to Yazdani's gold medal.\n\nAaron BROOKS (USA) won the 2023 U23 world title in Tirana. (Photo: United World Wrestling / Kadir Caliskan)\n\nYazdani has a solid underhook and has improved his conditioning but Brooks' defense is top-notch as Taylor found out at the trials. A wait-and-watch counter-attacking bout can ensue if the two meet in Paris.\n\nBrooks is unseeded and will be drawn at random in the 16-wrestler bracket which means he can face any of the top wrestlers in the first bout.\n\nMyles AMINE (SMR), who won a historic bronze for San Marino in Tokyo, is returning, hoping to stand on the podium again. Dauren KURUGLIEV (GRE) is another master of defense and will be a tough case to crack for any wrestler. \n\nOsman NURMAGOMEDOV (AZE), Magomed RAMAZANOV (BUL), Vladimeri GAMKRELIDZE (GEO), Hayato ISHIGURO (JPN) and Azamat DAULETBEKOV (KAZ) are some other potential medal hopefuls in Paris.\n\nFS 57kg: History on line\n\nWhen Spencer LEE (USA) won the U.S. trials, he did not know if he was going to the Olympics. He still had to qualify the 57kg weight for the U.S. He did so at the World Olympic Qualifier in Istanbul, in dominating fashion, barring one bout. Lee, a former U17 and U20 world champion, has now set his sights on the gold medal.\n\nBut at 57kg, the bracket is among the toughest in recent times. World champions Stevan MICIC (SRB), Zelimkhan ABAKAROV (ALB) and Rei HIGUCHI (JPN) are trying to achieve the same. Add to the list the European and Asian champions in Arsen HARUTYUNYAN (ARM), Aliabbas RZAZADE (AZE), Vladimir EGOROV (MKD), AMAN (IND) and Gulomjon ABDULLAEV (UZB).\n\nHowever, Lee has extra motivation to perform in France, his mother's native country.\n\n\"This is a big deal for me,\" Lee said in Istanbul. \"My family lives in France. They live outside of Bordeaux. My grandmother has never seen me wrestle and it's a really big deal for me to compete in my mother's home country.\"\n\nRei HIGUCHI (JPN) won the Budapest Ranking Series in June. (Photo: United World Wrestling / Kadir Caliskan)\n\nHiguchi, a silver medalist from Rio 2016, has dabbled with 65kg but returned to 57kg to make the Tokyo Olympics. He missed the weight at the qualifiers. But a strict diet, planned weight cut and experience have helped Higuchi return to the Olympics. However, he doesn't think too much about the loss against Vladimir KHINCHEGASHVILI (GEO) in the final in Rio.\n\n“I don't look back at my matches. I want to move on. Next match,” he told UWW last year. \"I don't feel bad about missing the Tokyo Olympics. The day I lost the chance to represent at the Tokyo Games, I began preparing for Paris.”\n\nIn his preparation for Paris, Higuchi has taken to cooking special meals for himself to keep his weight under control, training with specific partners, and enjoying the journey. He also got married and has a kid.\n\nBut for Olympics, Higuchi's battle begins well before he steps on the mat as he reduces at least seven kilograms.\n\n\"The aim is to lose 2kg of body fat per month,\" Higuchi was quoted as saying by Yahoo. \"In my case, it takes about three months to bring weight to 59kg, and then I think the best way to lose the last 2kg is to cut out water and lose it before the match. When losing weight, start with a low-fat diet, and when you can't lose any more weight, switch to a ketogenic diet [restricting carbohydrates and consuming fat]. Repeat this process. And it's important to consume carbohydrates from a low-fat diet before a match.\"\n\nAnother wrestler heading to Paris with a weight cut on his mind is the reigning world champion Stevan MICIC (SRB), who defeated Higuchi in a thrilling 57kg final in Belgrade. Micic is the first Serbian world champion in Freestyle and will look to add a historic Olympic medal.\n\nMicic, however, has only competed once since winning the World Championships. He won the gold medal at the Dan Kolov tournament at 61kg.\n\n\"First time competing since the World Championships, up at 61kg,\" Micic said on his YouTube channel. \"I would give myself 9/10 this time. In my first match against Iran, he was young and motivated, any match against Iran is tough. At this kind of tournament, you are not supposed to be perfect. It's getting yourself that feeling of competition out of the way.\"\n\nStevan MICIC (SRB) won the world title at 57kg in Belgrade in 2023. (Photo: United World Wrestling / Kostadin Adonov)\n\nIn Paris, he wouldn't have to worry about an Iran wrestler though. Iran failed to qualify the 57kg weight class. However, it is yet to be seen if that will help Micic improve his 14th-place finish at Tokyo.\n\nAlso, Higuchi is hoping to avenge that loss in the final if the two meet in the final.\n\n\"I'll definitely pay them back in the real thing [Olympcis],\" he said. \"I know quite a bit about what technique my opponents will use and when. What are my weaknesses? I'm not that worried. I think that all I have to do is make small adjustments and corrections. I think I have to win the gold medal in Paris. After all, I love this sport and I've been doing it for a long time, so I have a strong desire not to lose.\"\n\nA post shared by Olympic Wrestling (@unitedworldwrestling)\n\nAbakarov and Harutyunyan will look to end up on the podium as well. Harutyunyan had a high-scoring bout against Higuchi before going down in the World Championships semifinal. Abakarov, after suffering a loss to Micic, returned to win the bronze medal by beating Tokyo Olympic champion Zavur UGUEV (AIN). Then there are Asian hammers in Abdullaev and Aman. While Adbullaev is going to his second Olympics after finishing fifth in Tokyo, Aman will be making his debut.\n\nWW 57kg: Three-way battle for supremacy\n\nWill the 57kg Olympic gold medal stay with Japan? The country which has dominated women's wrestling ever since it was added to the Olympics is expected to continue it. It has won the 55-58kg gold medal at all editions. So can Tsugumi SAKURAI (JPN) keep it with Japan?\n\nSakurai, a three-time world champion, has a strong 2-on-1 attack to go with her defense. However, that did not work in the final of the Asian Championships this year as she lost 5-2 to Yongxin FENG (CHN). Fortunately for Sakurai, Feng is not the Chinese representative in Paris.\n\nTsugumi SAKURAI (JPN) executes a 2-on-1 attack. (Photo: United World Wrestling / Amirreza Aliasgari)\n\nDespite the loss and a wake-up call before Paris, Sakurai was composed in her assessment of the bout, saying that her opponents are coming in with plans against her,\n\n\"I think everyone knows my style of wrestling,\" Sakurai said after the Asian Championships. \"I have to train so that even if I get stopped, I can still find a way to score points. No matter the tournament, my objective is always to win the title. When you lose, there has to be a reason for the loss. I will look at this as I'm glad it wasn't the Olympics, and I will practice hard up to August.\"\n\nUndoubtedly, Hong too will be ready with her coaches to pull off an upset. Hong has been on a roll this year, winning the Zagreb Open and Budapest Ranking Series, apart from winning the Paris qualification in Bishkek. In Zagreb, she defeated Anastasia NICHITA (MDA) and then 59kg world champion and compatriot Qi ZHANG (CHN) in the final. She would once again beat Zhang in Budapest in the semifinal and win the gold with a win over ANSHU (IND).\n\nBut the world will be watching Maroulis, who made her third straight Olympics. She won the first-ever gold for the U.S. in Rio by beating the legendary Saori YOSHIDA (JPN). She won bronze in Tokyo after dropping the semifinal against Risako KINJO (JPN). And Maroulis looks good for a third medal at the Olympics.\n\nShe lost only to Sakurai at the World Championships but won the Pan-Am Championships and the Poland Open this year. Maroulis has the habit of peaking towards the second half of the season in which the World Championships or the Olympics are held.\n\nNichita, the world silver medalist, can surprise anyone on her day but a recent injury and her loss to Anshu in Budapest must have given her a wake-up call. Currently training in Italy, Nichita can create history by winning the first medal at Olympics in Women's Wrestling, given Irina RINGACI (MDA) doesn't to do on day one.\n\n United World Wrestling 2025 - All rights reserved\n\nFacebook\n\nInstagram\n\nTikTok\n\nX\n\nVK\n\nType here to search \n\nNo data available "

But now researchers have said the clinical benefits of ice therapy are not evidence-based and its popularity is bad for the environment.\n\nWith the Paris Olympics starting on Friday, academics from France, Qatar, India and Switzerland argued in an editorial, published in the British Journal of Sports Medicine, that the use of ice at the summer Olympic Games has reached “extraordinary levels” despite the lack of proven efficacy.\n\nThe amount of energy and water needed to produce, store, and transport the ice is not good for the planet, to say nothing of its cost, they added.\n\nWhile about 22 tonnes of ice were delivered to the competition venues of the Tokyo 2020 Olympics for medical purposes and another 42 tonnes were provided in the Olympic Village, the requirement for the 2024 Paris Olympics vastly exceeds those figures, the academics noted.\n\nInitial estimates were for 1,624 tonnes of ice – at a cost of €2.5m – but after no independent vendors were able to fulfil the public tender the Paris games revised its estimate to 650 tonnes (450 for the Olympics and 200 for the Paralympics), the paper said.\n\nCold-water immersion accounted for about 10% of treatments prescribed by physiotherapists at the Olympic polyclinics in Athens 2004 and London 2012, rising to 44% by Rio 2016. Of the immersions, 98% were for recovery purposes with the rest treating injuries.\n\nWhile cold-water immersion is good for treating heat exhaustion, after exercise in hot temperatures, and for muscle soreness, it should not be used for recovery between consecutive bouts of high-intensity training, nor for immediate or long-term recovery after resistance exercise.\n\n“Ice usage at the summer Olympics has reached extraordinary levels, potentially stressing local and regional resources,” the academics concluded. “When planning for the provision of ice, organisers should aim to minimise the use of non-evidence-based practices and promote better sustainability. Ice should remain available for certain situations, including acute pain relief, specific recovery needs, and management of exertional heatstroke.”\n\nResponding to the findings, Dr Paulina Kloskowska, a lecturer in sports and musculoskeletal physiotherapy at King’s College London who often works with elite athletes, said that high-level sport had always operated on the “outskirts of evidence” to achieve “marginal gains” in performance, injury prevention or recovery, and that concerns about the overuse of ice were valid.\n\nShe said: “There is increasing data emerging that heat therapy is in fact better for long-term muscle recovery in such circumstances, and that early and frequent ice and cold therapy can decrease the tissue resilience, the capacity to bear loads, or adapt in a healthy way.”\n\nDr Richard Budgett, the International Olympic Committee’s medical and scientific director, said the study should help ensure the Games use ice as effectively and as rationally as possible. “In addition, there are ice alternatives available, including a cooling system with filtered water chilled to 10C, allowing us to considerably reduce energy consumption. We will continue to monitor this aspect carefully [for] viable evidence to further reduce the amount of ice used at future Games, aligning with best medical practice.”"

The big one this time is the food in the village, which is not adequate.\n\n“There are not enough of certain foods: eggs, chicken, certain carbohydrates.\n\n“And then there is the quality of the food, with raw meat being served to athletes.\n\n“They have got to improve it over the next couple of days dramatically.\n\n“Our athletes have decided they would rather go and eat in our performance lodge in Clichy.\n\n“So we are having to get another chef to come over as the demand is far exceeding what we thought it would be.\n\n“The athletes are not going there just to eat their lunch, they are packing meals for their dinner as they don’t want to go into the athlete restaurant to eat.\n\n“So we are trying to make sure our athletes have an advantage by having more food.”\n\nOLYMPICS LIVE BLOG: Keep up to date with more news from the Olympics at our daily live blog\n\nMeanwhile, an unnamed British athlete told The Times: \"The food is a challenge at the moment.\n\n\"They are not as organised as you’d expect and the Japanese [at the previous Olympics] were so organised.\n\n\"Now it is chaos with loads of people coming in the last few days.\n\n“They are saying the Games are more sustainable and there is way more plant-based food.\n\n\"But sometimes if you go at peak times it’s challenging to even get a piece of chicken.”\n\nSodexo Live is the company in charge of catering in the village and a spokesman told L'Equipe it \"takes very seriously\" feedback from athletes and \"is working to increase our supplies to the restaurants in the athletes' village\".\n\nHe added that eggs and grilled meats are \"particularly popular and volumes have therefore been increased to satisfy the needs of the athletes\".\n\nAs part of sustainability measures, organisers have insisted all ingredients be locally sourced, with a focus on minimal waste and plant-based foods.\n\ntalkSPORT brings you live coverage of the Paris Olympics this summer, with Sir Steve Redgrave and Dame Kelly Holmes among our legendary line-up of pundits.

Davids hacked and dribbled and popped up for Tristan Leyds to score. Leyds converted both.\n\nBut deep in added time, New Zealand kept the ball alive and Moses Leo slipped Rosko Specman to cross for a converted try.\n\nNew Zealand continued to attack in waves in the second half but the South Africa defense was incredible. Davids and Ryan Oosthuizen stood firm on their tryline, Shilton van Wyk made another try-saving tackle on a tearaway Akuila Rokolisoa, and Ronald Brown’s last-ditch tackle ended a gripping match.\n\nFrance enjoyed an almost perfect first half, much to the delight of the 69,000-strong crowd.\n\nAndy Timo cut inside his marker and scored, then Aaron Grandidier Nkanang scored twice in three minutes; the first from a ruck turnover, and the second from Jefferson-Lee Joseph’s offload. Rayan Rebbadj converted all three for 21-0.\n\nUnlike the world series grand final, which France controlled in Madrid, Argentina made a comeback through its two best players, Rodrigo Isgro and Marcos Moneta, to close to 21-14.\n\nBut with more than two minutes to go, and one of them with a man advantage while Jordan Sepho was in the sin-bin, Argentina couldn’t get the ball back.\n\nInstead, France ground out the meters, and in the last seconds replacement Antoine Dupont quick-tapped to himself and scooted 25 meters untouched to put the result to bed.\n\nFiji crushed its pool and looked to be doing the same in the quarters when Iosefo Baleiwairiki bullrushed from inside his half and scored after just 30 seconds.\n\nBut Ireland played a patient game, and Chay Mullins barged over for two tries to give them a 10-7 halftime lead.\n\nIn the new half, Zac Ward reached out to the left corner flag for Ireland’s third try and 15-7 but, crucially, they could not add any extras.\n\nFiji’s rally started from its own tryline.\n\nSelesitino Ravutaumada broke out from his 22, and was at the other end to offload for Joji Nasova to score and for Fiji to trail by three.\n\nAt the restart, Ireland missed the catch, Baleiwairiki slapped the ball back and Waisea Nacuqu put Fiji back in front with a try converted by Terio Tamani Veilawa.\n\nIreland had two minutes of regulation time, and more than three minutes of added time, but its last attack died on a grounded pass on halfway that Fiji claimed.\n\nNathan Lawson’s break and offload gave James Turner the opening try in the fifth minute as Australia comfortably handled the misfiring Americans.\n\nFrom a ruck turnover on its 22, Australia countered and Henry Hutchison’s break led to a walk-in try by Corey Toole and a 10-0 lead at halftime.\n\nIn the second half, Toole was denied a second try when Malacchi Esdale tackled him into touch but the U.S. couldn’t get into synch to sustain an attack.\n\nIn the last minute of regulation, Australia replacement Maurice Longbottom kicked a penalty. The Americans tried to finish on a high, but Australia’s defense pinned them and Longbottom stole a try.\n\n___\n\nAP Olympics: https://apnews.com/hub/2024-paris-olympic-games\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCopyright 2025 The Associated Press.

During the previous Olympic cycle, shortly after they had started travelling together, Neeraj would often implore Klaus to “adopt” him. “Neeraj would say, ‘Coach, you stay in a beautiful village, you have a wonderful life. Why don’t you adopt me?’ And the coach would just laugh,” recalls Ishaan Marwaha, Neeraj’s physiotherapist.\n\nAfter Neeraj’s Tokyo gold, Klaus turned the tables on his ward. “Now, the coach tells him, ‘You are a rich man now. Why don’t you adopt me?’ It’s been so many years but the joke still cracks them up,” Ishaan adds.\n\nIn many ways, this sums up the relationship between the reigning Olympic champion and his coach. It’s not one of dutiful reverence or dispassionate coexistence. Despite half a century separating them in age, they find common ground to connect and still have enough room for gentle ribbing and leg-pulling.\n\n“There’s no generation gap. We listen to each other, that’s the secret of our relationship,” the 76-year-old says.\n\nTheir lives intersected at NIS Patiala in late 2019 when Klaus, at Neeraj’s behest, was appointed his coach. It was barely a year after Klaus was roped in by the Athletics Federation of India as an assistant to the then javelin coach Uwe Hohn.\n\nHohn guided Neeraj to gold medals at the Commonwealth and Asian Games in 2018, but his insistence on heavy training left Neeraj cagey. “Hohn’s was a very East German style of training, which meant going heavy. Neeraj felt the training was putting him at an injury risk, so he decided to move on. The great thing about Neeraj is that he is a very self-aware athlete. Right from the start, he knew what would work for him,” Ishaan says.\n\nWhile he is open to experimenting, Neeraj straddles the fine line between innovation and complication. “These days, you have a lot of things — advancements in training techniques, food and more. But if we talk about athletes earlier, like Jan Zelezny, who holds the javelin world record with a 98.48m throw, they had simple training and it worked. So I try to not overcomplicate things. I try to focus on the simple things,” he had said at the HT Leadership Summit last November.\n\nOnce during his early days at NIS, a young Neeraj was not convinced with the training methods of one of the coaches, and so he convinced the authorities to let him train alone. By the time he moved from Gary Calvert to Hohn and finally Klaus, Neeraj was a finished product.\n\n“I didn’t have to do much with him. He was already throwing 85-87m consistently,” says Klaus.\n\n“He came across as a modest and shy boy. Changing coach was a very tough decision for him but he knew what he needed. Our relationship started to develop right from the first day, from the moment we met. It evolved step by step, day by day without our realisation. It’s like getting old...you don’t realise you get old every day. You realise these things only when you reflect,” the coach ruminates.\n\nA renowned biomechanics expert, Klaus believes in sharing little nuggets rather than long-winded explanations. “I prefer to let the athlete decide for himself. Neeraj is quite inquisitive and if he is interested in a particular input, he wants to know everything about it,” he says.\n\nPost his Tokyo high, Neeraj made a conscious decision to shift his training base overseas. While Europe has been a preferred choice, he has also trained in USA and South Africa in the three years leading upto Paris. The training plans are carefully curated with Neeraj, Klaus, and Ishaan brainstorming over their objectives, logistics, and competition schedule. \n\n“After Tokyo, I found out how international athletes plan their schedule and choose their training centres so that there is minimum travel, quicker acclimatisation, and proper diet leading up to a major event. These are finer details that I discuss with my coach and a decision is made,” Neeraj had said in March, before the start of his competition cycle. \n\n“Success depends on teamwork. My coach and physio make immense contribution. The coach reviews my technique and we talk on what’s the best style for me. We also have a specialist for strength training. Planning has been the key,” he added.\n\n“These are very democratic discussions,” says Ishaan. “There are disagreements and debates, but the idea always is to decide what’s best for Neeraj. Once everyone is onboard, we go head-on.”\n\nSerious as it sounds, their training and workout sessions are usually interspersed with healthy banter. Neeraj’s go-to workout music is Punjabi and it’s not out of character for him to pull Klaus into an impromptu jig. He has even taught the coach a few Hindi words. “I tell him to block like a pahad (mountain) and stretch like a dhanush (bow),” Klaus says.\n\n“Both my children are elder to Neeraj. I am 50 years older than him. But I don’t look at him as my son or a grandson. I am his coach and he is my athlete. We have a lot of fun, but the professional dynamics of the relationship never change.” Which means that Neeraj is the boss of the triad and all their plans –- from training to shopping to dining out -- are tailored to his preferences. On days when Neeraj is unusually intense in training, they know something is amiss.\n\n“We know how and when to keep a distance. He is super fun to be with but when he goes silent, we back off a little. You get to understand these things with time,” adds Ishaan, who has been associated with Neeraj since 2017 through JSW Sports.\n\n“I am around ten years elder to Neeraj, which means we have a lot of things in common, but I make a conscious effort not to get too personal with my athletes. It is in their best interest,” he says. That, however, hasn’t stopped Neeraj from exchanging funny Instagram reels with him or regularly checking on Ishaan’s nine-month-old son. When the mood hits him, Neeraj reads about outer space and after having his fill on the subject on YouTube, approaches Ishaan with queries ranging from aliens to spaceships.\n\n“We once found ourselves passionately deliberating on the differences between Swiss and Polish societies. We love to talk about everything under the sun,” says Klaus.\n\nNeeraj followed the recent general election results in India closely and even attempted to explain the workings of the Indian political system to Klaus, a history buff. Days later, when the T20 World Cup took place in the US and the Caribbean, the reigning world champion followed India’s progress through Ishaan.\n\n“Neeraj is a Virat Kohli fan, and he kept telling me that Kohli will fire in the final. He likes to follow all sports, wherever Indians are competing.”\n\nTheir off days are usually spent recovering and planning for the week ahead, and on the odd occasion when there is no competition lurking, the trio indulges in a rare movie night on the projector that Neeraj carries along.\n\n“We once watched a movie involving snakes and coach Klaus was quite freaked out. It was hilarious,” recalls Ishaan. Eating out is usually out of the question, but Neeraj has developed a liking for an Italian pizzeria close to their German training base in Saarbrucken.\n\n“He made me try some tikkas at an Indian restaurant once...it was too spicy for me,” laughs Klaus.\n\nTheir dinner table discussions usually revolve around sharing family updates and “silly nonsense stuff” while competition mornings involve a short pep talk from Klaus.\n\n“We don’t discuss technical details during competitions. I try to keep his mind uncluttered, and tell him to trust his training,” the coach says.\n\nWhile Klaus unsurprisingly counts Neeraj’s Tokyo gold as his most memorable moment with his athlete, Ishaan fondly remembers the endless walks with Neeraj while he was recovering after his elbow surgery in 2019.\n\n“He had zeroed in on a shopping mall and we would just walk there the entire day, listening to his insecurities and dreams. I feel those conversations have deeply strengthened our bond,” says Ishaan.\n\nA podium finish is most certainly on their Paris wish list, but they don’t discuss opponents or medal probabilities too much. “He is a gifted athlete, not just because of his physical prowess but also his clear head,” says Klaus. “He knows how to win on a big day.”\n\n\n\n"

An obvious reason why these contests had started so early, two days before the opening ceremony, was the hope that this highly rated French team, topped by a sprinkling of Antoine Dupont’s greatness, would set the tone as France’s first athletes in competition for an incredible event to come.\n\nBut in their opening contest of the day, three and a half hours earlier, France had stumbled to a 12-12 draw against a solid USA team. Under no circumstances could that be repeated.\n\nTheir return to the pitch was soundtracked by roars of “Allez les Bleus” and multiple renditions of La Marseillaise from a full crowd of nearly 80,000 spectators. But again, they were sluggish and sloppy against a gritty Uruguayan team. They closed out the first half of their must-win game trailing 5-7.\n\nThe moment demanded a touch of brilliance, and it was only ever going to come from one soul. Early in the second half, Dupont snatched the ball from the halfway line and off he went. He weaved, stutter‑stepped and twirled, and after tearing across the pitch while breaking free of his pursuers, he finished his ridiculous solo run with an essential try. That would be the last time that France were behind as they closed out a tense 19-12 win.\n\nNone of this was a surprise. Dupont has demonstrated his genius time and time again, establishing himself as one of France’s greatest athletes in recent times. He has already methodically compiled a tremendous résumé, leading his club and country to significant trophies while also garnering countless individual accolades.\n\nMany others would have been satisfied with such a career and trajectory at 27 years old, yet it is a reflection of both his ambition and talent that he has taken on the challenge of adapting to and excelling at a different variation of his sport in pursuit of Olympic gold on home soil.\n\nIf it wasn’t clear from the innumerable adverts around Paris that Dupont was a face of the Games, then the sight of Emmanuel Macron recently positioning himself next to Dupont during a visit to the athletes’ village for a cool photo op was telling. As Dupont showed once again, there is a reason for all of this hype.\n\nThe question after the first day, particularly as Fiji followed up their 40-12 demolition of Uruguay with a similarly convincing 38-12 win against USA, is whether the team as a collective is up to it. Although France have qualified, their match against Fiji on Thursday will be an instructive test.\n\nWhile Dupont is made for these moments, not everyone is ready for the pressure of playing at home under significant pressure. After the opening draw with USA, Jordan Sepho, who scored France’s first try of the Games, reflected that nervousness. “We let ourselves be carried away a little by the euphoria of the public and the first match, so we had a lot of dropped balls,” he said.\n\nSign up to Olympic and Paralympic briefing\n\nOur daily email briefing will help you keep up with all the goings on at the Olympics and Paralympics \n\nafter newsletter promotion\n\nThere could certainly be no criticism of the audience’s voice. Not only did they fill out the enormous Stade de France, but they were scathing of the Argentinian team, booing them at every opportunity. While sporting relations between Argentina and France may have already been difficult following their World Cup final, recent videos of the Argentina football team belting out racist chants regarding the origins of black French football players after their Copa América victory seem to have ensured that Argentina will be the villains of the Olympic Games this year.\n\nThere remains ample caution from many Parisians; there are frustrations about the dead zone around the river Seine, fears about security and low expectations about how the public transport will handle the next three weeks. Some people have even left the city until this is all over. But at its heart, this is a nation that loves its sport, and on the first day of competition the audience’s passion was truly felt.\n\nAfter the match, while the rest of the French team showed their appreciation to the crowd, drawing fans to a frenzy by ringing a comically large bell situated on the pitch and then departing centre stage, Dupont’s performance was not yet finished.\n\nHe walked down the long line of reporters to the side of the pitch, offering comments in English and French, before finally leaving his stage alone. There is plenty resting on his shoulders, but he has shown many times they are built to handle that weight and much more."

The outfit is all set to compete in the Paris Olympics as two-time champions. \n\nFijian rugby 7s legend Waisale Serevi – a winner of two World Cups and three Commonwealth Games medals and widely considered one of the greats of the format – says reactions were almost unanimously positive when he announced in June this year that he was headed to India to coach the sport here. \n\n\n\n                            Waisale Serevi, called the King of Rugby. \n                                                    \n\nThere was plenty of support on Fijian social media too, but interspersed with less charitable comments here and there. \n\n“Indians also play rugby?” asked one.        “They will be playing real rugby not Bollywood rugby,” read another. While those might seem like outliers buried in a sea of otherwise encouraging messages, the sentiment is all too familiar. \n\nALSO READ | Indian wrestler Reetika Hooda - Will make sure fans remember my name after the Olympics\n\n\n\n                            When it begins its campaign at the Paris Olympics, the Fiji men’s rugby 7s team goes in as defending champion. Indeed, it also won gold at the 2016 Olympics in Rio, when Rugby 7s was introduced in the Olympic roster. That gold medal was the first-ever for Fiji at the Olympics.\n                                                            | Photo Credit: \n                                Getty Images\n                                                    \n\nRugby is immensely popular in the archipelago nation. The national Rugby Team’s Facebook page has 600,000 followers in a country with a population of a little over 900,000. The Flying Fijians - as the national team is known - have punched well above their weight. This is especially true in the Rugby 7s, which features seven players on each side in contrast to the 15-a-side matches of the traditional format.\n\nWhen they begin their campaign at the Paris Olympics, the Fiji men’s rugby 7s team goes in as defending champions. Indeed, they also won gold at the 2016 Olympics in Rio, when Rugby 7s was introduced in the Olympic roster. That gold medal was the first-ever for Fiji at the Olympics.\n\nRugby is more than a sport in Fiji. Gareth Baber, who had coached the Fiji 7s Rugby team to a gold at the Tokyo Olympics, calls the islanders’ connection to the sport and team as an emotional and spiritual one and not just a sporting one. \n\n“... it’s about connection with national pride, connection with Fijian people, and particularly how they’re perceived overseas,” Baber had said in an        interview with the BBC back in 2021.\n\nBut while rugby is indeed emblematic for Fiji, it isn’t completely representative of the entire Fijian population. At none of the three Olympic Games that they have taken part in, has Fiji fielded an Indian-origin player – a major part of the demographic. Infact, only two players, that too of part-Indian ancestry – Jack Prasad and Ben Volavola – have ever represented Fiji at the international level.\n\n\n\n                            Ben Volavola (L) is one of two people with Indian ancestry to represent Fiji at the international level. \n                                                            | Photo Credit: \n                                Getty Images\n                                                    \n\nFiji isn’t, of course, the only country where players of a certain ethnic origin seem to lack representation in certain sports. No Indian origin players have played for the Springboks (South African rugby team) or the Wallabies (Australian rugby team) either. However, neither of those countries have nearly the same ratio of citizens of Indian origin as Fiji does. Four out of ten Fijians are of Indian origin. None of the members of two-time Olympic champion rugby teams are. \n\nNearly 40 per cent of the population of Fiji are of Indian origin – the descendants of indentured farm labourers who were brought from India to work in the country’s sugarcane plantations in the 1800s – at a time when both nations were part of the British colonial empire. That number used to be upwards of 50 per cent even a couple of decades ago until a number of Indians emigrated from Fiji following military coups in 1987, 2000 and 2006 - the first two of which were in response to the election of a multi-ethnic government with Indian-origin Fijians having a share of power.\n\nIt’s a phenomenon that hasn’t gone unnoticed.\n\n“The population of Fiji is roughly 60 percent indigenous and around 37 per cent Indian-Fijian. They are a huge part of the islands but they’re largely absent from the imagery of popular culture and sport. The imagery of Fiji itself, the national, almost ethnic national imagery of Fiji is the muscular indigenous Fijian, in a traditional dress. You rarely see the Indian Fijian in popular Fiji culture This is true particularly in sport with a couple of exceptions – probably Vijay Singh in golf and (ISL player) Roy Krishna in football,” says Dr. Jack Sugden, lecturer at Liverpool John Moores University and the author of        ‘Untangling complexity: The ethnic, gender and class dimensions in Fijian sport and society’.\n\n\n\n                            File photo: Fijian Roy Krishna has roots in Kolkata. \n                                                            | Photo Credit: \n                                Getty Images\n                                                    \n\nMuch of this, argues Sugden, is due to the deeply entrenched stereotypes of the two communities which have their background in colonial policy. The indigenous tribal population was mostly left to themselves while Indians were brought over to work as indentured labourers on sugarcane plantations. The land itself was owned either by the state or by the native Fijians. Indeed, the native Fijians prefer to be identified as i-Taukei – which literally means owners of the land.\n\n“You end up having two sets of people. The workers, who are the Indians, and the people that are there to symbolize Fiji, to govern Fiji, to protect Fiji - ‘the real Fijians,” says Sugden. \n\n“When Fiji won its independence in 1970, the British left a power vacuum that people assumed would be filled by indigenous Fijians. But the economic power was in the hands of the Indian Fijians because when the sugarcane plantation owners left, they left the keys in the hands of the Indian workers. That set the scene for success in business for one group, whereas indigenous Fijians were kind of left there, almost directionless in terms of economics,” says Sugden.\n\nIn that cultural uncertainty, where other avenues for progress seemed closed for them, rugby, introduced by the British in the early 1900s eventually became a source of i-Taukei identity and pride.\n\nThis wasn’t always the case. Growing up in the capital Suva in the 1970s, Biman Singh, a former sports reporter from Fiji — who asked that his name be changed for this article — recalls how the rugby team at his school, in the capital Suva, used to be a fairly diverse one.\n\n“Although, rugby was first brought in by the British as a way to ‘civilize’ the tribal population, everyone across communities used to play it. I remember eight of the 20 players in the team from my alma mater — Marist College — which won the national schools championships in the 1960s were from the Indo-Fijian and Fijian-Chinese communities. They weren’t the majority of the team but they were there in significant numbers,” he says.\n\n\n\n                            File photo | Meli Derenalagi, left, and Bolaca Napolioni of Fiji with their gold medals following victory in the Men’s Rugby Sevens gold medal match between Fiji and New Zealand at the Tokyo Stadium during the 2020 Tokyo Summer Olympic Games in Tokyo, Japan.\n                                                            | Photo Credit: \n                                Getty Images\n                                                    \n\nSingh, though recalls, that by the time he himself started playing in the 1980s, things had changed. The perception was that Indians were simply not cut out to play rugby. Like many stereotypes, this isn’t entirely untrue. \n\n“The Indian people in Fiji are descended from immigrants who came from Bihar, Gujarat and Tamil Nadu. When you compare us to the i-Taukei people there is a fundamental difference in size and strength,” says Singh.\n\nThe stereotypes weren’t just about physicality, says Sugden. \n\n“I lived in Fiji. I trained with a rugby team that had one or two Indian Fijian players and when they played against other teams, these players would be targeted more so than the indigenous islanders. That is to do with perceptions of them being weaker players. It’s also to do with some, I guess, latent prejudice towards Indian Fijians that exists across the Fijian islands. Indian-Fijians can be seen as weaker, more cautious, less able to deal with physical pain or less able to deal with the rough and tumble of sport,” says Sugden.\n\nWhile these stereotypes doesn’t necessarily seem to hold true consistently — Waisale Serevi, considered one of the all-time greats in Rugby sevens, is himself only 5’7— the fact is they have also been internalised by the Indian-Fijian community. \n\nALSO READ | Neeraj Chopra: ‘Need to compete with         hosh and         josh at Paris Olympics’\n\n“Even in the 1980s, if my father ever caught me playing rugby with i-Taukei players, I’d catch a thrashing for sure. He’d say I’d get injured playing against them. If that happened that could have an effect on my studies. We were told we had to focus on our studies. The i-Taukei schools on the other hand had a huge focus on rugby,” says Singh.\n\nHe wasn’t the only one who was nudged towards leaving the sport. ISL (Indian Super League) player Roy Krishna has said in an interviewthat although he loved rugby he was asked by his parents to switch sports since “you needed to be strong and tall to play well and I wasn’t one of them.”\n\nThere were cultural factors that aided the shift as well. If Roy Krishna started out as a rugby player who eventually had to shift to football, it was the other way around for Serevi.\n\n“I started playing soccer when I was young. But in Fiji, soccer is mostly played on Sundays and Rugby is played on the same grounds on Saturdays. As a young person, things were very strict. We couldn’t play on Sundays,” says Serevi. With Serevi’s family, like the vast majority of i-Taukei Fijians, being devout Christians, this meant he ended up sticking to rugby.\n\nEven today, while Indians tend to dominate the administrative board of Fiji football, it is i-Taukei Fijians who control that of the rugby federation. \n\nThere is an economic factor at play as well. \n\n“For Fijians, rugby is the main sport because even if you don’t make it in Fiji, you still have the opportunity to go abroad, play rugby and earn money. The culture in Fiji is to help your family, relatives and village when you make money so when a Fijian rugby player goes to play abroad, that money makes a big difference to people back home,” says Serevi.\n\n“Indeed, as Indian Fijians gained more prominence particularly in the business world, a lot of indigenous islanders who incidentally suffer from poverty just as much as Indian Fijians, are quite resentful towards that. So there is that tension there as well. So when you get Indian Fijians, even Fijians of mixed heritage who are, let’s say, crossing that individual, invisible sort of ethno-racial boundary in sport, they do tend to receive abuse from the sidelines, they tend to be targeted at greater levels, and it can be hard for them at times,” says Sugden.\n\n“They genuinely didn’t encourage us to stick around,” says Singh. “If there was any Indian-origin rugby player playing in the local leagues, some of the spectators would heckle them. They’d call them        ka’india which literally means from India but it’s used as a pejorative. Even now, if I post something critical of the team, I’ll often get a comment from an i-Taukei Fijian who will ask what an Indian will know about rugby,” says Singh.\n\nBridging the divide\n\nWhile Indo-Fijians are almost entirely absent from professional rugby, Fijians of mixed ancestry have had more success.\n\nIn recent years, Ben Volavola – the son of an Indian-origin father and a mother of indigenous descent has been amongst the most successful, competing 38 times including at both the 2015 and 2019 World Cups as a fullback for Fiji since his debut in 2015. However, according to Singh, even Volavola, who was born, raised and learned his rugby in Australia, has not had it easy. \n\n“Ben’s father is a man named Dinesh Shankar. But if Ben went by the name Ben Volavola Shankar, I guarantee it would have been a lot harder for him to play as many matches as he did,” says Singh.\n\nWhile Volavola was never included in the Olympics squad, there will still be one Fijian of Indian origin present at the Paris Olympics. That would be former New Zealand All Black Rocky Khan, who is currently the assistant coach of the Chinese Women’s Rugby 7 team. Khan, the son of an Indian-origin father who represented Fiji internationally in football and an indigenous mother from the island of Rotuma, is proud of his Indian heritage and believes his success has shown stereotypes don’t necessarily need to persist.\n\n\n\n                            Former All Black Rocky Khan, who is currently the assistant coach of the Chinese Women’s Rugby 7s team. \n                                                            | Photo Credit: \n                                Special Arrangement\n                                                    \n\n“I guess it was different growing up in New Zealand but my father was always a big fan of rugby and even in New Zealand I kind of went with the flow because rugby is such a big part of the culture there. I don’t really fit the mould of what a typical rugby player looks like so I’ve had those kinds of conversations as well but I use that as kind of fuel to try and achieve my goals,” says the 5 foot 10” Khan who last played as a halfback for New Zealand at the 2018 Hong Kong sevens competition.\n\nKhan believes there’s no good reason more Indo-Fijian players don’t make a mark for themselves. “I guess the only limits are the limits that you put onto yourself. I always say, if I can do it, anyone else can,” he says. \n\nIn India, Serevi, who says he grew up speaking Fijian Hindi and eating Indian food believes the same. \n\n“I think there’s no shortage of talent in India. There’s no reason Indian players can’t be good rugby players,” he says.\n\nWhile change is slow, it’s definitely happening. \n\nALSO READ | Living in exile, Afghan sprinter Kimia Yousofi ready to run for change\n\n“Back in the 1980s, it was hard to even be a fan if you were Indo-Fijian. There would have been four or five of us even watching a game at a stadium in the 1980s. It’s different now. Even though Indo-Fijians aren’t a part of the team as players, there’s massive support for the team. Many of the team’s sponsors are companies run by Indians (The chief sponsors of the domestic competitions for instance is CJ Patel Industries),” says Singh.\n\nIn a way, Sugden says that rugby will end up following the overall trend in Fijian society. \n\n“Sport is seen as a way to bring people together. However in terms of representation, rugby is one of those sports that keeps Fiji more separate than it actually is in reality. In real life, at the community level, there’s not much hatred between most Indian Fijians and indigenous islanders. There’s lots of intermarriage. They’ll eat the same food, they often speak the same language and they’ll probably be watching the games together,” he concludes. \n\n\n                Comments\n            \n\n\n                    Paris Olympics\n                \n                        /                      \n                    \n\n\n                    Roy Krishna\n                \n\nBACK TO TOP\n\nTerms & conditions  |  Institutional Subscriber\n\nComments have to be in English, and in full sentences.

It is practical, it is communicative, it is commercial, and it is competitive. \n\nLooking towards the fashion of Paris 2024, some countries have multiple uniforms for the opening and closing ceremonies, podiums, media and sporting events. Some countries tell subtle or extravagant stories of their nations. The Parisian style of the host city inspires some.\n\nSome countries want to use the latest technology to produce sustainable fabrics or recycled materials. Some countries have used designers and brands to fashion their formal uniforms. \n\nTheir commonality is they represent their country and communicate their national presence and essence.\n\nMy top five opening and closing ceremony uniforms have been considered. The countries with notable fashion brands are not favoured; my selections are based on the design’s story, meaning and overall aesthetic. These top five evoke a creative expression of national pride that resonates with my lens and preference of fashion and style. \n\nThe Haitian opening ceremony uniform, fashioned by Haitian-Italian designer Stella Jean, represents and showcases Haiti’s beauty, strength and craft.\n\nIncluded are the work of the Haitian painter Philippe Dodard in the women’s full-A-line skirt and the men’s pants and scarf. Pairing brilliantly with the art are the other layers of blue and white.\n\nThe women are styled in Haitian woven chambray shirts, representing the Haitian tradition of chambray production. Recycled fabric is the basis of the women’s short-sleeved white blazer, which features the Haitian Olympic emblem.\n\nThe men’s blue jacket is inspired by Haitian Guayabera shirts, both significant for the designer and a common Haitian garment. This jacket features the Haitian Olympic emblem and underneath a blue-striped shirt.\n\n\n\nMongolia’s opening and closing ceremony uniforms were crafted by the three-sister fashion label Michel&Amazonka. Each uniform, which averaged 20 hours to make, incorporates multiple cultural and Olympic-themed motifs.\n\nThese intricate details include the emblem of Mongolia, the “Soyombo”; Parisian and Olympic motifs, such as the Olympic torch and rings; and mountain and cloud landscapes.\n\nFour different opening and closing ceremony uniforms were designed for the male and female flag bearers and athletes. The flag bearers wear a traditional-inspired caftan and a belt; the athletes in pants and skirt.\n\nAll four looks showcase embroidered vests, with the men sporting blue and the women white. The vest, front and centre, announces “Go Mongolia Team”.\n\n\n\nCanada’s lululemon-crafted uniforms were designed after consultation with 19 Olympic and Paralympic athletes across 14 diverse sports.\n\nNational pride was identified as a key priority and is significantly present in the uniforms. The other priorities were practicality, flexibility and comfort.\n\nIn the opening ceremony uniform, the brand custom-designed a print representing Canadian art, design and environment. \n\nThe equistite closing ceremony uniform features First Nations (Saddle Cree) artist Mason Mashon’s print inspired by the northern lights.\n\nEach uniform has been crafted for comfort, including a packable rain poncho, a bomber jacket with interior straps to act as a makeshift backpack and water-resistant shirts. \n\n\n\nDesigner Laura Weber’s creation of the Irish Opening Ceremony outfits and Closing Ceremony jackets is heavy with symbolism and sustainability.\n\nBased in New York, the designer created the uniform for the athletes to feel their best, be comfortable in the fabrics, and celebrate their Irish culture.\n\nThe sustainable fabric, made from recycled t-shirts and PET bottles (ECO-Hybrid taffeta), pulls moisture from the skin.\n\nDeciding against a prominent green, the aesthetic of the uniform is a crisp white with delicate embroidery featured throughout.\n\nThe embroidery includes the Irish flag in the pant piping, hand-made shamrock brooches on the jacket lapel, hand-tufted letters spelling Ireland, and custom, individual patches representing the county emblem of each athlete. \n\n\n\nThe ceremonial uniform of Taiwan, refered to by the International Olympic Committee as Chinese Taipei, represents eco-friendly materials and cultural heritage. Designed by the founder of Just In XX, Justin Chou, the stretchy and textured material represents Taiwan’s oceans, cities and mountains.\n\nThe outfits are made from materials that cool down the body when in contact with water or sweat.\n\nCollaborations with artisan Yen Yu-Ying produced shoe tops made from banana silk woven leather. Lin Pei-ying crafted handmade plum blossom, Taiwan’s national flower, and rapeseed flowers to adorn the coat. \n\nAbstract artist Lin Guo-Qing created the shirt and scarf print. Designed in red, white, and blue team colours, the repeated text in a crosshatch pattern reads Chinese Taipei and, when reversed, Jiayou, an expression of encouragement.\n\n\n\nThese uniforms are for the athletes to perform their best, be proud of their national outfits and feel they genuinely represent them. \n\nAll the uniforms are captivating, whether simple, elegant, innovative, practical, unique or futuristic.\n\nI am drawn to the design processes and stories of these five countries’ uniforms. Translating a country’s design through sporting fashions is a considerable challenge – and one these countries have risen to.\n\n\n\nSafeguarding in Sport: Understanding the Risks\n          —\n          New South Wales\n \n\n\n\nCertification Short  Course\n          —\n          New South Wales\n \n\n\n\nOutcomes Focused Program Evaluation\n          —\n          Sydney, New South Wales\n \n\n\n\nOutcomes Focused Program Evaluation\n          —\n          Sydney, New South Wales\n \n\n\n\nMovement and Place\n          —\n          Sydney, New South Wales\n \n\n\n      Copyright © 2010–2025, The Conversation Media Group Ltd\n"

        "expanded content": "Ethan Ewing will be ready with, or without, a sex bed. Photo: Pablo Jimenez//ISA\n\nThe Olympic surfing competition coming up at Teahupo’o later this week will look much different than WSL Championship Tour contests. Out with Christian iconography and coaches and surfers in the channel. In with secret service agents, freesurfing slots, tattoos and sex beds. The following is how the Olympics will differ from the CT. \n\nOut with…\n\nCrucifixion sprays\n\nNot that the Championship Tour is awash with Christian iconography, but it’s always nice to know that it’s there if the surfers need it. Not in the very secular Olympics though. The IOC’s remit is “no kind of demonstration or political, religious or racial propaganda is permitted in any Olympic sites, venues or other areas.’’ That meant Joao Chianca had to remove his Rio-inspired Christ the Redeemer graphics from his quiver. Carissa too, we’ve heard, had to rethink her Satan sprays. We aren’t sure about Caroline’s Marxism. With sponsor’s logos also banned, expect clean, logo-free boards, not seen since Tom Curren won the Hyland Pro at Haleiwa back in 1991 (Google it kids). \n\nCoaches \n\nUnlike the Tahiti Pro, where the surf coaches are in the channel, and provide immediate feedback after each wave, they are banned from the water. Instead, they will be stuck on the cruise ship watching the broadcast, five miles northwest of Teahupo’o, or getting a tattoo (more on that later). Sure, surfers are used to competing without coaches in the water, but Teahup’o was one of the few places where that was possible and perhaps needed the most. \n\nThe Flotilla\n\nCoaches won’t be the only ones missing out. The whole usual flotilla that jams the reef pass during CT events will largely be absent. Olympic regulations will clear the water in the name of safety, leaving a few Olympic dedicated press boats, athletes, and their official minders, and that’s about it. That includes athletes in upcoming heats. ‘‘Normally we can just drive a Jet Ski or a boat to the lineup whenever we want to watch heats and hang around Teahupo’o,’’ Molly Picklum told the Sydney Morning Herald. ‘‘Just to get a feel and you feel the energy even by just watching it. This time police and security are guarding it every single day from the (time) we land. It’s just really strict. We can’t get out there to watch heats.’’\n\nAnd in with…\n\nTattoo Parlors\n\nIn a series of firsts, The Aranui 5 cruise ship is not only the world’s first Olympic Floating Village but also has the first, “tattoo studio at sea.” You’d think that would be a license to print money, given Olympic athletes’ compulsive need to draw five rings on their bodies at any opportunity. The Aussies, aka the Irukunjis, and Team USA, will miss out on the ink, having coughed up to stay on land for the duration.\n\nSecret Service Agents\n\n“If may feel like we’re in paradise. But things can happen anywhere, even in paradise,” Mike Bjelajac told USA Today. The 46-year-old Wisconsin native is the State Department’s Diplomatic Security Service (DSS) agent assigned to protect Caroline Marks, Carissa Moore, Caity Simmers, Griffin Colapinto, and John John Florence in Tahiti. They should be in safe hands. The DSS is a sister agency to the U.S. Secret Service and Bjelajac has guarded former Secretaries of State Hillary Clinton and John Kerry. Bjelajac wasn’t allowed to say if he would be armed, or reveal any of his tactics. But if someone doesn’t make a b-grade Hollywood movie starring Mathew McConaughey as the operative, our world is doomed. \n\nFreesurfing Slots\n\nWhile the Teahupo’o lineup will be cleared except for Olympic surfers for five days before the start of the window on July 28, the athletes will get allocated sessions to train. Rain, hail, onshore, swell or sun, each country’s surfers will get a slot, and surf in whatever conditions prevail. \n\nSex Beds\n\nThe Olympic Village in Paris has recyclable single beds made from cardboard, like the ones first used in Tokyo. These were dubbed “anti-sex beds” after American track and field runner Paul Chelimo claimed the beds were aimed at avoiding intimacy among athletes. Not in Tahiti though. Posts on the cruise ships by athletes Kanoa Igarashi and Yolanda Hopkins show traditional “sex beds” in the cabins, and we can assume the same goes on land. \n\nShaper’s Logos\n\nThose surfers of a certain vintage will remember when shapers’ logos took the prime real estate on the best surfers’ surfboards The big R. of the Rusty, Channel Island’s Hex logo, or The A of Aloha, to name a few, were the dominant graphic. The surf brands, and their big athlete contracts, took over and have owned the space for two decades. Except for two weeks in the Olympics when the shapers, finally, get their own space. The logo won’t be on the nose but will be at least standalone. About bloody time. \n\nOnly the best. We promise.\n\nJoin our community of contributors."

Canada is scheduled to play New Zealand on Thursday, July 25. (AP Photo/Silvia Izquierdo)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCanada women’s soccer coach Bev Priestman said Wednesday she’ll step away from the team’s opening game against New Zealand at the Paris Olympics in the wake of a drone scandal.\n\nNew Zealand complained to the International Olympic Committee’s integrity unit after it said drones were flown over closed practice sessions earlier in the week. Canada, the defending Olympic champion, was set to open the Paris Games on Thursday against New Zealand in Saint-Etienne.\n\nIn the fallout of the complaint, two staff members — assistant coach Jasmine Mander and Canada Soccer analyst Joseph Lombardi — were sent home, the Canadian Olympic Committee said Wednesday.\n\nPriestman said she was voluntarily removing herself from the opener “with the interests of both teams in mind and to ensure everyone feels that the sportsmanship of this game is upheld.”\n\nIn a statement, Priestman also apologized to New Zealand.\n\n“On behalf of our entire team, I first and foremost want to apologize to the players and staff at New Zealand Football and to the players on Team Canada,” she said. “This does not represent the values that our team stands for.”\n\nAssistant coach Andy Spence will lead Canada in the opener.\n\nPriestman also spoke briefly in person to reporters after training.\n\n“By no means did I direct the individuals,” she said. “I’m still learning the details and obviously this is all unfolding. But again, I think the important thing right now is to look forward, put the actions in place and take the sanctions.”\n\n\n\n\nFIFA, soccer’s international governing body, said its disciplinary committee had opened hearings against Canada Soccer, Priestman, Lombardi and Mander. Canada Soccer announced late Wednesday that it would conduct an independent review.\n\nThe COC confirmed Tuesday that a nonaccredited member of Canada’s soccer team staff was detained by French authorities after a drone was spotted above training.\n\nA French court on Wednesday sentenced a 43-year-old Canadian man to an eight-month suspended sentence for filming two of New Zealand’s closed training sessions with an aerial device.\n\nThe man, who was not named, admitted to the charges and identified himself an independent sports analyst for the Canadian federation, according to the Saint Etienne prosecutor David Charmatz.\n\nThe COC also apologized to the New Zealand Olympic Committee and New Zealand Football.\n\n“The Canadian Olympic Committee stands for fair play and we are shocked and disappointed,” the statement said. “We offer our heartfelt apologies to New Zealand Football, to all the players affected, and to the New Zealand Olympic Committee.”\n\nThe NZOC said it and New Zealand Football “are committed to upholding the integrity and fairness of the Olympic Games — at this time the NZOC’s main priority is to support the New Zealand women’s football athletes and wider team as they start their campaign.”\n\nIt’s not the first time a Canadian soccer team has been involved in a drone controversy involving an international rival’s training session.\n\nIn 2021 at Toronto, Honduras stopped a training session ahead of its men’s World Cup qualifier against Canada after spotting a drone above the field, according to reports in Honduran media. The teams played to a 1-1 draw.\n\n___\n\nAP Summer Olympics: https://apnews.com/hub/2024-paris-olympic-games\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCopyright 2025 The Associated Press. All Rights Reserved."

At that time, I was quite confused and felt that I may not qualify for the Olympics,” said Zii Jia to the Badminton World Federation.\n\n“I had a lot of problems in my game play and confidence. After I lost in the first round of the Indonesian Open in 2023, I said I have to quit for a while as I wanted to get back my love for badminton.\n\n“A lot happened and when I look back now, it was a tough challenge and I overcame it and here I am.\n\n“After I qualified for the Olympics, I was quite relieved but I also told myself that it’s not easy to qualify for two.\n\n“At this moment, I’m enjoying myself on court.”\n\nIndependent shuttler Zii Jia’s continuous defeats in the preliminary rounds had been notoriously consistent and the final blow was a first-round defeat to Lakshya Sen of India in the first round of the 2023 Indonesian Open in June where he decided to quit the sport temporarily.\n\nSuch was the confused state of his mind that he needed a break from the game and waited eagerly for the arrival of his new coach Wong Tat Meng.\n\nThere has been transformation in his game since then and he went on to win the Thailand Masters, the Australian Open and finished as the Malaysian Masters runner-up just before the Games.\n\nZii Jia was always known for his attacking flair but he is an open book for opponents who can counter his smashes effectively and Tat Meng was patient in adding more weapons into the player’s arsenal.\n\nThis meant that Zii Jia would have to shift from being an all-out attacking player and become an all-rounder, a trade that has served reigning Olympic champion Viktor Axelsen of Denmark so well for years.\n\n“Tat Meng tried to add something, which was to make me more like an all-round player,” said Zii Jia.\n\n“Before this, I was only an attacking player, not many rallies and defensive shots from me. I’m more comfortable now and just not smashing all the way.\n\n“I train hard but I’m also enjoying the moment.\n\n‘‘I’m bringing this positive energy and vibes to Paris.’’\n\nZii Jia is out to achieve what no Malaysian has done before, which is to win the elusive gold medal at the Olympics.\n\nWith Zii Jia’s imposing presence, his potential rivals like top seed Shi Yuqi of China, Anthony Ginting of Indonesia, Anders Antonsen of Denmark and big man Axelsen will be on guard to tackle the re-energised Malaysian warrior at the Adidas Arena from July 27-Aug 5.\n\nThank you for your report!\n\nCopyright © 1995-\n            \n\n Star Media Group Berhad [197101000523 (10894-D)]\n\nBest viewed on Chrome browsers.\n\n\n\nWe would love to keep you posted on the latest promotion.

And if an athlete or a staff member had that conviction, they wouldn’t be allowed to be a member of our team.”\n\nMeares noted Australia has several teenage athletes in the squad.\n\n“We have very stringent policies around the safeguarding within our team,” she said.\n\n“We have full confidences in those policies and the training that we’ve put our staff and athletes through to have awareness.\n\n“We do have a number of athletes under 18 and under 16 and so those policies are well in action for safeguarding of our team.”\n\nVan de Velde has been booked into accommodation away from the village while he has also been banned from talking to the media.\n\nAustralia have two teams in the men’s beach volleyball competition but cannot face van de Velde, who will play in Pool B with teammate Matthew Immers, until the knockout stage.\n\nIzac Carracher and Mark Nicolaidis won their spot barely a month ago to join the nation’s No.1 pair Zachery Schubert and Thomas Hodges.\n\nHodges switched from indoor volleyball to form a high-energy partnership with Schubert, the fun-loving pair both overcoming long-term injuries to also be among the contenders for Paris gold in their Olympic debuts.\n\n“I had double knee surgery after the last Games,” Schubert, who farms crickets as part of a family side business, said.\n\n“Hodgey’s been a huge help during that process. It’s you and your mate competing, for a year-and-a-half over the qualifying period.\n\n“It’s full on; you have to be good mates because you ride the highs and lows. So being here, in Paris, this is what we dreamed about.”\n\nBeach volleyball will take place inside a temporary stadium beside the Eiffel Tower.\n\n“It’s incredible, I mean look at her,” Artacho del Solar said after getting sand between her toes at the venue on Monday.\n\n“It’s just stunning, so special to be playing here, such an iconic event ... it’s one of my favourite cities and I just think the Eiffel Tower is so magical.\n\n“But once I step over those green lines (that border the court), it’s just like everything’s a blur, white noise.

Read our Privacy notice\n\nOlympic diver Tom Daley has shown fans what the 2024 Paris Olympic Village cardboard beds really look like. \n\nBefore the prestigious athletic competition officially kicks off in a few days, the 30-year-old Olympian gave his TikTok followers a sneak peek at the polarizing cardboard beds in this year’s Olympic Village. In a July 22 TikTok, Daley vouched for the eco-friendly furniture’s sturdiness, showing skeptical viewers evidence of its sound structure by knocking on the headboard and pulling at the bedpost.\n\n“This is cardboard,” Tom explained to viewers. “Then you’ve got the mattress and then this cardboard with the mattress on top with a mattress topper. And then, we get our own Paris ‘24 [comforter].”\n\n“Rêvez vos exploits de demain,” the top of the bed reads, translating to “Dream about your achievements of tomorrow.” The 30-year-old athlete showed viewers the cute detail as he jumped on the bed, adding: “As you can see, they’re pretty sturdy!”\n\nThe beds have been subject to scrutiny from athletes and viewers alike since they were introduced during the 2020 Olympics in Tokyo, however, many Olympic athletes took to social media to show viewers that the beds were not only sturdy but comfortable as well. \n\n“The bed in the video has since been recycled,” Israeli baseball player Ben Wanger said in a since-deleted TikTok video showing him and eight of his teammates jumping on a bed to disprove the viral rumor that the Olympic committee had chosen the cardboard sleeping set-ups to discourage sex among the athletes. “We actually enjoy sleeping on these beds, and think they are a great and sustainable option for future Olympics.”\n\nOlympic organizers stressed that they weren’t intended to be “anti-sex” beds, but instead symbolize the competition’s commitment to sustainability. \n\n“We know the media has had a lot of fun with this story since Tokyo 2020,” Olympic organizers told Reuters in May. “But for Paris 2024, the choice of these beds for the Olympic & Paralympic Village is primarily linked to a wider ambition to ensure minimal environmental impact and a second life for all equipment used during the short period of the Games.”\n\nDespite stressing that they weren’t created to curb the Olympic athletes’ sexual appetites, rumors of the after hours extracurriculars aren’t unfounded. In the past, Olympians like figure skater Kristi Yamaguchi, 53, have openly acknowledged the effects the competition has on athletes, especially in terms of the goings on in the Olympic village. \n\n“The Olympics is an incredible experience,” the gold medalist explained to E! News earlier this year. ”All around you, you’re meeting so many incredible idols and people you look up to. I think people, of course, after they finish competing, are enjoying themselves.”\n\nHost countries began distributing condoms to athletes starting with France in 1992 during the Winter Olympics in Albertville. According to Sky News, an estimated 150,000 condoms were handed out at the Tokyo Games, and with pandemic-era restrictions being lifted for the Paris games, a reported 300,000 condoms will be available this year. \n\nJoin thought-provoking conversations, follow other Independent readers and see their replies\n\nPlease refresh the page or navigate to another page on the site to be automatically logged inPlease refresh your browser to be logged in"

Andreas Obst – the MVP of last year’s German win over the US in the World Cup semi-finals – had 14, while Dennis Schroder had a 13-point, 10-assist night.

That was against Serbia, the team that’ll face the US on Sunday in the first Olympic game this summer for both teams.\n\nCanada gave the US problems at times, Australia came from way behind to make things interesting at the end, South Sudan nearly pulled off an upset as a heavy underdog and the Germans had the lead over the US with four minutes left on Monday.\n\nThen it was James’s time. He outscored Germany 11-6 by himself in the final 3:57.\n\nAnd now, Paris awaits. The games start for real this weekend."

        "expanded content": "Adidas has issued another apology amid criticism regarding its SL72 sneaker campaign, which has been linked to the tragic events of the 1972 Munich Olympics. The German sportswear company expressed regret in a statement  that specifically addressed concerns raised by model Bella Hadid and other prominent campaign partners.\n\nThis follows Hadid hiring attorneys  to take action against Adidas “for their lack of public accountability” for putting out a campaign that “would associate anyone with the death and violence of what took place at the 1972 Munich Games,”  US Weekly reported Sunday.\n\n Entertainment & Arts \n\nAdidas removes Bella Hadid from an ad campaign and apologizes after backlash over the pro-Palestinian model’s role in promoting shoes tied to 1972 Munich Olympics.\n\nAdidas acknowledged the unintended implications of its marketing approach, which coincided with the anniversary of the Munich Olympics.\n\n“Connections continue to be made to the terrible tragedy that occurred at the Munich Olympics due to our recent SL72 campaign. These connections are not meant and we apologize for any upset or distress caused to communities around the world,” Adidas stated in its apology, which was released to TMZ. “We made an unintentional mistake. We also apologize to our partners, Bella Hadid, A$AP Nast, Jules Koundé, and others, for any negative impact on them and we are revising the campaign.”\n\nThe controversy arose when Adidas selected Hadid, alongside rapper A$AP Nast, soccer player Koundé and others, to promote its SL72 project, a nostalgic nod to the brand’s iconic 1970s running shoe. The campaign’s timing, however, struck a sensitive chord due to its timing with the 42nd anniversary of the Munich massacre, where Palestinian militants in the Black September group killed 11 Israeli athletes and coaches in a hostage situation that lasted 20 hours. A West German police officer and five of the terrorists also died. \n\nAdidas was condemned by Jewish organizations and Israel, who criticized the company for linking the campaign with a model known for her strong pro-Palestinian sentiments and Palestinian ancestry on her father’s side. The American Jewish Committee denounced Adidas’ decision, labeling it as either a “massive oversight or intentionally inflammatory.”\n\n Real Estate \n\nMohamed Hadid’s code-violating mega-mansion in Bel-Air, which a judge ordered to be torn down, has sold at auction for $5 million.\n\nIn response to the backlash, Adidas emphasized its commitment to diversity and inclusivity in a statement to The Times.\n\n“The adidas Originals SL72 campaign unites a broad range of partners to celebrate our lightweight running shoe, designed more than 50 years ago and worn in sport and culture around the world,” the spokesperson said. \n\n“We are conscious that connections have been made to tragic historical events — though these are completely unintentional — and we apologize for any upset or distress caused. As a result, we are revising the remainder of the campaign. We believe in sport as a unifying force around the world and will continue our efforts to champion diversity and equality in everything we do.”\n\nThe biggest entertainment stories\n\nGet our big stories about Hollywood, film, television, music, arts, culture and more right in your inbox as soon as they publish. \n\n You may occasionally receive promotional content from the Los Angeles Times. \n\nFollow Us\n\nAsia Moore was a 2024 reporting intern on the Los Angeles Times Fast Break Desk, covering entertainment news.

        "expanded content": "\nIt wasn't pretty, but thanks to the heroics of                 LeBron James\n\n, Team USA managed to hold on and survive a resilient and hungry South Sudan squad to avoid perhaps the most monumental upset in international basketball history.     \n\nThe Americans had no business being in a barn-burner affair against the 33rd-ranked team in the world basketball rankings, in a tune-up game no less. In the same vain, the lone nation that will represent Africa in the 2024 Paris Olympics had no business being up 16 points at one point and almost taking down a United States team laden with future Hall of Famers and NBA stars, if not for the heroics of a near 40-year-old legend who stubbornly continues to defy Father Time.\n\nAs the best basketball nation in the world, Team USA has a target on its back. Other countries will always put their best game forward whenever they're up against the United States. USA's path to gold in Paris 2024 is not going to get any easier, even in the lead up to the tournament, which tips off on July 26th.\n\nAfter the win, James echoed his preference for these close-call games. \n\nSouth Sudan may have given the wake-up call the Americans needed ahead of the tournament. But Team USA's next assignment may be its biggest pre-Olympic test yet.\n\nThis upcoming game between Germany and the United States at the O2 Arena in London is just an exhibition. But that doesn't mean both teams will take this encounter lightly. \n\nGermany is out to prove that they are still a force to be reckoned with after winning the 2023 FIBA World Cup, where they dispatched the United States in the semi-final and eventually captured their first ever gold medal at the tournament.\n\nFor Team USA, this game will be about revenge. The United States' embarrassing loss in last year's FIBA World Cup, where they failed to land a podium finish, prompted Team USA Basketball to bring in its best crop of talent to Paris 2024. \n\nDespite the new-look cast, the ghosts of last year's loss will likely still be on the minds of the Americans heading into Monday. \n\n\nThis is a very different United States team from the one that Germany defeated a year ago. USA's 2023 FIBA World Cup roster was headlined by                 Anthony Edwards\n\nand                 Tyrese Haliburton\n\n, the only two returning players on this year's Olympic lineup. Now, the two budding stars are coming off the bench of the Americans, who are led by LeBron James,                 Stephen Curry\n\n,                 Kevin Durant\n\n, and                 Joel Embiid\n\n.    \n\nBut no matter how loaded this USA cast is, this is still a largely make-shift roster with little continuity. This group has not played together for long. They just started training camp on July 6th, which was just over two weeks ago. \n\nChemistry plays a huge role in winning basketball games, and it's safe to say they are still figuring out how to play with each other. \n\n​​​​​\n\nTeam USA - Olympic Preparation Games\n\nOpponent\n\nResult\n\nScore\n\nCanada\n\nW\n\n86-72\n\nAustralia\n\nW\n\n98-92\n\nSerbia\n\nW\n\n105-79\n\nSouth Sudan\n\nW\n\n101-100\n\nSure, USA is 4-0 in preparation games. But they haven't been as dominant as expected and that is in large part due to their lack of chemistry. The near-disaster against South Sudan is a clear indication of that.\n\nOn the flipside, Germany has brought back 10 players from their World Championship team into their 2024 Paris Olympics roster. Cohesion may not be a major issue for the Germans, considering the majority of their national team's core players have been playing alongside each other for quite some time now.\n\n\nLed by team captain                 Dennis Schröder\n\n and brothers                 Franz Wagner\n\n and                 Moritz Wagner\n\n, Germany is also hungry to prove that they can replicate their success in the Olympics.    \n\n\nGermany has gone 3-1 in their tune-up games so far. Their lone defeat came against France, but they did not have the Wagner brothers and NBA veteran                 Daniel Theis\n\n for that exhibition.    \n\nGermany - Olympic Preparation Games\n\nOpponent\n\nResult\n\nScore\n\nFrance\n\nL\n\n90-66\n\nFrance\n\nW\n\n70-65\n\nNetherlands\n\nW\n\n95-50\n\nJapan\n\nW\n\n104-83\n\nAll of this is part of the United States' process to reclaim their spot atop the world stage of basketball — a title that Germany currently proudly possesses.\n\nMore than anything, Team USA is banking on its star-power to get them to the top of the podium. Most of the time, the Americans' sheer talent alone is enough to win them gold. They're not the winningest nation in basketball if they don't have the best crop of players in the world.\n\nLuckily for the United States, this upcoming tilt against Germany is still just a tune-up. But it should serve as a huge test that will give them an idea of just where they are at as a ball club.\n\nNonetheless, losing won't be the end of the world for the United States. There won't be any need to push the panic button should the Germans come out on top of this exhibition. However, a loss should give Team USA the wake-up slap it needs to realize that the path to the gold medal won't be a cakewalk.\n\nWith his career coming to an end, a gold medal in the 2024 Olympics may be the last major award of Lebron James' basketball career.\n\nWe want to hear from you!

The event will also be the first instalment of the quadrennial sportsfest since the International Olympic Committee (IOC) unveiled its Olympic AI Agenda.\n\nYou might be wondering why the Olympics – founded in 1896 in imitation of the famous athletic contest of ancient Greece – needs an “AI agenda”. What can computers do to help the human body’s quest to reach higher, faster and stronger? \n\nThe answer, according to the IOC, is quite a lot. The committee’s far-reaching agenda envisions a world in which AI systems aid athletes in reaching their peak performance, help to ensure fair play, optimise event operations, and transform the spectator experience. \n\nThe goal, according to IOC president Thomas Bach, is “to set the course for the AI future of sport with responsible leadership by embracing the change while preserving the Olympic values”. \n\nMost of what the IOC has in mind is quite specific to sport, but some of it is the kind of AI applications that could be used by organisations in many fields.\n\nChief among sport-focused uses of AI are those that focus on individual athletes. By evaluating huge data sets based on performance, physical traits, and skills, AI systems can make it easier to spot talent. These systems could operate on a large scale and might identify people who are currently being missed.\n\nAI could also play a role in helping talented individuals become world-class athletes. We are already seeing AI systems designed to support coaches by providing personalised training plans. \n\nOptimising training and uncovering hidden patterns in the behaviour of individuals or groups of athletes is another promising application of AI models. Coaches can use these models to adapt training strategies continuously through feedback.\n\nAI training systems can be more affordable and accessible than traditional coaching. There are also AI tools that can analyse video of movements such as a tennis swing in real time and provide feedback – and some need no more equipment than a smartphone.\n\nOrganisations such as Swimming Australia are already using AI tools to interpret athlete data using natural language.\n\nAI-powered tools are also changing injury prevention and rehabilitation. By analysing biomechanical data, training logs and medical records, AI can identify injury risk factors and provide personalised recommendations to avoid them. \n\nFor instance, AI models can analyse an athlete’s movement patterns to detect imbalances, suggesting targeted exercises and corrective techniques to reduce injury risk and enhance recovery. Research also shows AI technologies can identify knee injuries with accuracy comparable to physicians, potentially reducing the need for specialised medical practitioners.\n\nThe IOC also believes another key use for AI is to help make sport more fair.\n\nTechnological aids for officials are not new. Think of cricket’s decision review system, the NRL’s bunker, and electronic line calling in tennis. The FIFA World Cup’s “semi-automated” offside technology uses AI. \n\nAI judging is also coming to gymnastics. For casual viewers, it can be hard to understand why one gymnast gets a higher score than another. \n\nIn a bid to make judging more transparent, a judging support system was employed across all apparatus at the 2023 world championships. This AI-based tool strictly matches gymnast movements to the rulebook, and may make the sport more accessible for viewers.  \n\nNew technologies and digital innovations also make the Olympic Games more accessible for fans.\n\nDuring the 2020 Tokyo games (actually held in 2021 due to the COVID pandemic), digital engagement doubled compared to the Rio games of 2016, with Australia being one of the top countries for consuming digital content.\n\nA recent survey showed Australian audiences generally oppose AI-produced political news, but they are more accepting of AI-generated sports content.\n\nMore recent research from IBM showed 55% of global tennis fans surveyed believe AI will positively impact sports. This sentiment reflects a growing acceptance of AI’s role in enhancing the experience for fans.\n\nThe IOC wants to use AI to create “more personalised fan experiences”, but we don’t yet know exactly what those will be.\n\nAway from the sport itself, AI will also be used in an effort to improve efficiency, reduce costs and enhance sustainability in the Olympics. This will be for things such as optimising transportation, workforce training, logistics and ticket sales. \n\nThe IOC plans to share the knowledge gained from this year’s games with other sports organisers to help them create more engaging and cost-effective events. \n\nAI technology will be used to safeguard athletes and officials from social media abuse. An expected half a billion social comments will be monitored during the 2024 Paris Olympics, with abusive posts automatically erased to protect athletes.\n\nIn sport as in the rest of society, it will be crucial to establish guidelines for safe and responsible implementation of AI. An important first step is to ensure data fed to AI systems is secure, accurate, fair and inclusive.\n\nIn 2014, the IOC launched a program of reform in a fast-moving world with the motto “change or be changed”. This imperative has taken on a new urgency with the rapid progress of AI technologies in recent years.\n\nAs we have seen, AI is making inroads at this year’s games, and we can expect to see even more of it at the Los Angeles games due in 2028 and the 2032 games booked for Brisbane. Are we ready to embrace it?\n\n\n\nIsland of ideas public talks series\n          —\n          Tasmania\n \n\n\n\nThe Promise and the Perils of AI\n          —\n          Tasmania\n \n\n\n\nThe Promise and Perils of AI\n          —\n          Sandy Bay, Tasmania\n \n\n\n\nFree public talk 'Safeguarding the Vulnerable in Conflict'\n          —\n          \n \n\n\n\nFree public talk 'Safeguarding the Vulnerable in Conflict'\n          —\n          Sandy Bay, Tasmania\n \n\n\n      Copyright © 2010–2025, The Conversation Media Group Ltd\n"

(ABC: Sharon Gordon)\n\nIt's a hot, cloudless day in north-west Victoria, and Royal Australian Air Force pilot Nicole Forrester is preparing for take-off.\n\nHer runway is unconventional – straight through a dusty paddock bordered by a simple Ringlock fence.\n\nIt would make for a dangerous and unconventional take-off in any jet or cargo plane, but she's not on the job today.\n\n\"I only started flying hang gliders about two years ago,\" she says.\n\nAt 35, Nicole is among the youngest of 43 hang glider pilots competing at the annual Flatter Than Flat Land event in Birchip.\n\nAs fellow pilot Peter Lissenburg explains, the sport is struggling to attract young members.\n\n\"Back in the '70s we had 500 pilots in Victoria,\" he says.\n\nThe 68-year-old began hang gliding at 18, at a time when his peers \"had already done their apprenticeship and picked up a car\".\n\n\"They got a full wage by the time they were 19 or 20, and they hadn't got mixed up with the girls yet,\" he tells triple j Hack.\n\nBut the biggest factor reducing participation, he says, is that \"there's a lot of things for young people to do these days\".\n\nPeter Lissenburg says paragliding has overtaken hang gliding in popularity. (triple j Hack: Angus Mackintosh)\n\nFrom thousands of metres in the air, pilots like Peter have a clear view of the generational shifts that are eroding participation in their sport.\n\nBut even at ground level, the winners and losers of Australia's evolving sport culture are becoming clear to see.\n\nEvery year, the national AusPlay survey aims to assess which sports are being played around Australia, and by how many people.\n\nFor the most popular activities – walking, gym fitness, athletics – it's a reliable tracker of what's keeping the country moving.\n\nBut for more niche pursuits – like rodeo, polo, and synchronised swimming – even the 20,000-person annual sample isn't enough to accurately count.\n\nThe rarest sports may not even merit their own category: hang gliding is amalgamated into a broader 'air sports' category.\n\nUntil 2019, sport climbing fell into that camp as well.\n\nBut the Oscar-winning 2018 documentary Free Solo and a debut Olympic event at Tokyo in 2021 helped change that.\n\nNow, AusPlay estimates over 100,000 Australians participate in sport climbing, with a further 350,000 involved in outdoor rock-climbing, abseiling or caving.\n\nTaken together, that figure exceeds rugby league and union combined.\n\nSarah Dalgleish is part of the wave of recently minted Australian climbers.\n\n21-year-old Sarah Dalgleish is one of the recent converts to rock climbing who train at this Ballarat gym. (triple j Hack: Angus Mackintosh)\n\nShe says the cooperative, social atmosphere of bouldering – a type of climbing which relies on crash mats instead of ropes to protect against falls – attracted her to the sport.\n\n\"[Regular] gyms do feel a bit judgey,\" she says.\n\n\"I feel like there's a bit of a pecking order, like there's always sort of someone who's been there a bit longer, more experienced, lifts heavier.\"\n\nJason Elshaug is the owner of the Ballarat bouldering gym where Sarah trains. He's been climbing for 20 years.\n\nJason Elshaug opened Ballarat's first climbing gym soon after the sport debuted at the Tokyo Olympics. (triple j Hack: Angus Mackintosh)\n\nOpened soon after climbing debuted at the Tokyo Olympics, his was the first indoor climbing gym in the city of over 100,000 people.\n\n\"There was definitely a noticeable uptick in interest and participation once the Olympics came through,\" he says.\n\nThis year, climbers Oceana Mackenzie and Campbell Harrison will compete for Australia at the Paris Olympics in two events, after the sport was expanded to receive a second medal category for 2024.\n\n\"It's gonna be really, really cool to cheer them on,\" Jason says.\n\nOf course, many Aussies will entirely miss the rise of climbing, or hang gliders' slow descent.\n\nAfter all, competitive team sports like soccer, basketball, and netball remain among the most popular physical activities, particularly for regional Australians and children.\n\nBut at junior levels, there's another change underway.\n\nSport science professor Rochelle Eime at Federation University says the COVID-19 pandemic marked a major drop in kids' sport.\n\nRochelle Eime is a professor of sport science at Federation University who analyses more than a million sport participant records every year for the Victorian Department of Health. (Supplied: Rochelle Eime)\n\n\"The overall number of Victorians playing sport is actually higher now than what it was pre-COVID,\" she says.\n\n\"But what we're seeing is, for the first time, a real decline in primary school-aged children.\"\n\n\"Those six-to-nine year-olds that would normally enter Auskick or FunNet – they didn't have school where they could pick up foundation skills through PE [during the lockdowns].\"\n\nThe inequity is felt most strongly in newly developed suburbs, where clubs haven't had time to take root.\n\n\"For five to nine-year-olds in metropolitan growth areas, only 33 per cent are playing sport compared to 71 per cent in regional areas, and for 10 to 14-year-olds, only 36 per cent in metropolitan growth areas compared to 70 per cent in regional areas,\" Professor Eime explains.\n\nRegardless of a sport's popularity in the community, clubs take time to mature.\n\nEquipment and infrastructure, a regular player base, and reliable staff – often volunteers – are all needed to keep the game going.\n\nSo, perhaps unsurprisingly, many of the country's fastest-growing activities don't require that kind of mass effort and resourcing.\n\nAusPlay points to gym fitness, walking, and running as examples of three fast-growing sports, while resource-intensive club-driven sports like golf, tennis, and squash have each declined since 2001.\n\nThe data seems to suggest accessible, non-competitive activities are thriving in Australia.\n\nBut that needn't exclude team sports.\n\nTo see how a large group can play together without referees, expensive equipment, or school-taught ball skills, look no further than ultimate – sometimes called ultimate frisbee.\n\n\"I find it a really fun and fast paced sport that's highly inclusive and very spirited,\" Ballarat Disc Sports' Leah Cushion says.\n\nLeah Cushion says ultimate frisbee is extremely welcoming, with no referees or expensive infrastructure required to start a club. (triple j Hack: Angus Mackintosh)\n\nShe and a few dozen others have gathered at a Ballarat park with only a few discs and some cones to mark the boundaries of their game.\n\nAs she explains, ultimate is entirely self-refereed by players, even at the highest level.\n\n\"It means you're accountable for your own actions,\" she says.\n\n\"The outcome decides where the disc comes back in – and then we play on.\"\n\nAusPlay estimates the number of Australians playing 'flying disc' – a catch-all term for ultimate and other disc activities – has more than doubled in the last five years to around 58,000.\n\nIt's closing in on hockey, a sport with a long Australian history that has nonetheless failed to grow its numbers from around 90,000 over the same period.\n\nAr half-time, another disc fan enters the field. (triple j Hack: Angus Mackintosh)\n\nFor Leah, inclusivity is key to ultimate's success.\n\n\"Everybody that rocks up to the sport is not expected to know how to play like [if they were] walking up to a netball or football club – it's really welcoming,\" she says before being subbed into the game.\n\nJust seven weeks before attending the hang gliding event in Birchip, Nicole gave birth to a baby boy.\n\n\"My son's in the car just behind us,\" she says.\n\n\"I'm still pretty fresh but I've got a really supportive partner over there, so he'll look after the baby while I go flying.\"\n\nTogether, the young family drove over 500 kilometres to attend the Birchip event from their home in Sale, improvising a hang glider rack for their Mazda 3.\n\nNicole Forrester is a pilot in the Royal Australian Air Force who spends her weekends flying hang gliders. (triple j Hack: Angus Mackintosh)\n\nThe mammoth effort speaks to Nicole's boundless love of flying, but perhaps also reveals why so few other young people have chosen to take up hang gliding over other, more accessible sports.\n\n\"You need to be a fairly adventurous type of person to get into it and you need to have the opportunity as well,\" she says.\n\nAltogether, she estimates having spent over $10,000 on a second-hand glider and training, but doesn't regret the effort or the price.\n\n\"Up there lying prone, to me it's the closest thing to being a bird,\" she smiles.\n\nTopic:Health\n\nAnalysis by Patricia Karvelas\n\nTopic:Foreign Aid\n\nTopic:Alternative Energy\n\nTopic:Courts\n\nTopic:Sport\n\nTopic:Sport\n\nTopic:Children's Health\n\nBallarat\n\nBirchip\n\nClubs and Associations\n\nCommunity Organisations\n\nCost of Living\n\nFrance\n\nMelbourne\n\nMountain Climbing\n\nOlympic Games\n\nSports Organisations\n\nSydney\n\nTopic:Health\n\nAnalysis by Patricia Karvelas\n\nTopic:Foreign Aid\n\nTopic:Alternative Energy\n\nTopic:Courts\n\nTopic:World War 2\n\nTopic:Children's Health\n\nTopic:Activism and Lobbying\n\nTopic:Indigenous Culture\n\nWe acknowledge Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples as the First Australians and Traditional Custodians of the lands where we live, learn, and work.\n\nThis service may include material from Agence France-Presse (AFP), APTN, Reuters, AAP, CNN and the BBC World Service which is copyright and cannot be reproduced.\n\nAEST = Australian Eastern Standard Time which is 10 hours ahead of GMT (Greenwich Mean Time)"

Read our Privacy notice\n\nThey say the hallmark of a champion is to perform when it matters most, when the pressure is highest, so what does that make Tadej Pogacar? A sadist, perhaps. On Sunday, with the yellow jersey already sewn up, with nothing to gain and everything to lose, he stormed to an otherworldly time-trial victory on stage 21, just because he could.\n\nHe had spent most of the past three weeks tearing the peloton to shreds, launching vicious attacks which splintered the chasing pack, each surge like a grenade thrown into the bunch. On this final ride, a 34km time-trial from Monaco to Nice, he fired one more, crushing not only his nearest rival Jonas Vingegaard but the time-trial world champion Remco Evenepoel too. Only in the last few metres of this 3,498km race did he let up, raising two hands to the sky as he crossed the line.\n\nThe Tour de France can be won in myriad ways. Geraint Thomas eked out seconds at opportune moments, gradually growing his gap. Chris Froome controlled every aspect of the race from inside his bunker of Sky domestiques. Here, Pogacar bullied the peloton from pillar to post, grabbing the yellow jersey on stage two, taking his first win on stage four and then obliterating his rivals on stages 14, 15, 19, 20 and again on 21.\n\nHis haul of six stages is the most of any Tour de France winner since Bernard Hinault in 1979. Aged 25, he has three yellow jerseys and is in the midst of a season from the gods, completing the first Tour-Giro d’Italia double this century. After losing to Vingegaard in 2022 and 2023, Pogacar has never looked stronger, reaching levels perhaps no modern-day rider ever has.\n\n“Already it would have been an incredible year, but to win the Tour de France is another level,” an emotional Pogacar said at the finish. “I cannot describe how happy I am. After two hard years in the Tour de France, this year everything went to perfection. This is the first grand tour where I was totally confident every day. Even in Giro I had one bad day but I won’t tell which one. This Tour de France was amazing. I was enjoying day one until today.”\n\nThe lasting images of this Tour will feature his explosive surge to the Plateau de Beille summit on stage 15’s Bastille Day, and his breathtaking assault on the final 16km ascent to the summit finish to win stage 19, hunting down the strong American climber Matteo Jorgenson who had a four-minute head start.\n\nHis rivals have been taken aback. Jorgenson looked like he’d survived a tsunami. “I heard Pogacar was coming. We were trying to keep as big a gap as possible because when Tadej launches...” he trailed off.\n\n“He’s not the same as us,” said Evenepoel, who fought gamely to finish third overall.\n\nPogacar’s teammate Joao Almeida said “it’s unbelievable how strong he is” and their manager at UAE Emirates, Matxin Fernandez, called him “the best rider I have ever seen”.\n\nPogacar has himself hailed what he called “the highest numbers I ever did in my career”, most notably that Plateau de Beille climb ridden at an estimated 6.98 watts per kilogram, which is like the average club rider sprinting full out, eyes popping. They might keep it up for 40 seconds; Pogacar did it for 40 minutes.\n\nAs with every Tour de France champion, great performances bring scrutiny as well as acclaim. The credibility question came into focus in the final week of the Tour after an investigation by Escape Collective revealed how elite teams are using controversial carbon monoxide rebreathing equipment in altitude training camps. The equipment can be used for performance enhancement, but the three teams asked – Visma, UAE Emirates and Israel Premier Tech – insist they use it only for measuring purposes. It is not specifically banned by the World Anti-Doping Agency.\n\nInitially Pogacar did not answer with great conviction, first saying he didn’t know anything about the equipment before later explaining that it was used only to measure training performance and not to enhance it. Vingegaard gave a similar response.\n\n“There will always be doubts,” Pogacar said on Sunday. “Because of cycling before my time, in any sport, if someone is winning, there’s always jealousy and haters ... I tell you now, it’s not worth it. Taking anything to risk your health is stupid.”\n\nThe bare facts are that Pogacar is one of the most tested athletes on the planet, and that he has not become a phenomenal athlete overnight. He would point to some significant changes made this season, switching coach, increasing heat training and dedicating himself to riding the immaculate time-trial, efforts which are clearly bearing fruit. Unlike Vingegaard, an injury-free year has created near perfect conditions.\n\nIt is tempting to wonder what sort of thrilling battle this race might have thrown up had Vingegaard not crashed so horribly in the Basque Country in April. He sustained a punctured lung, broke several ribs and a collarbone which required surgery, and his team said he would only go to the Tour if he was “100 per cent”.\n\nVingegaard was surprisingly close to his best, sticking with Pogacar on stage two and out-gunning him on stage 11 for a clever, defiant win. But this was not quite the Vingegaard who won the Tour so convincingly 12 months ago, and he finished six minutes off the pace.\n\nYet even a supreme Vingegaard may have struggled to close the gap. Pogacar is in the form of life. Before the Giro, he had already won Liege-Bastogne-Liege, Strade Bianche and the Volta a Catalunya. The only major race Pogacar has started and failed to win this year is Milan-San Remo, where he finished third.\n\nThere is still the World Championships in September, with more time for recovery after pulling out of the Olympic road race, and if he succeeds then it is legitimate to start placing his season among the greatest in the history of road cycling. Eddy Merckx’s 1972 is often referred to as the pinnacle, a year in which he won three Monuments, the Giro-Tour double and set a new Hour Record. If Pogacar was to complete the Giro-Tour-World triple crown, it would certainly come close.\n\n“Next I want to take the World Championship jersey,” he said. “It has looked very good on Mathieu van der Poel. I want one time to have the rainbow jersey on my back.”\n\nJoin thought-provoking conversations, follow other Independent readers and see their replies\n\nPlease refresh the page or navigate to another page on the site to be automatically logged inPlease refresh your browser to be logged in"

Here’s how it works.\n\n\nTadej Pogačar took victory on the final stage of the 2024 Tour de France with another blistering performance in the individual time trial to cap off an utterly dominant race. \n\nAn entirely yellow-clad Pogačar was last to set off at 18.45 local time and even had time to showboat in the final kilometre, holding up three fingers to indicate his three Tour victories. \n\nHe punched the air as he crossed the line and was immediately swarmed by teammates to celebrate not only another Tour de France but the historic achievement of the Giro-Tour double. \n\nThe top three in the general classification finished the time trial in that order, with two-time defending champion Jonas Vingegaard a minute and three seconds behind and third-placed Remco Evenepoel another 11 seconds back.\n\nPogačar finished the Tour 6 minutes 17 ahead of Vingegaard and 9 minutes 18 ahead of Evenepoel, who sealed the white jersey and third overall at his debut Tour but couldn’t replicate his win on stage 7’s time trial today.\n\nThe champion was jubilant at the finish line, telling reporters, “I’m super happy, I cannot describe how happy I am. After two hard years in the Tour de France, always some mistakes, and this year everything to perfection. It’s incredible. \n\n\"This is the first Grand Tour where I was totally confident everyday, even in the Giro I remember I had one bad day but I won’t tell which one! This Tour de France was amazing, I was enjoying from day 1 until today and I had such great support behind me. I just couldn’t let anyone down so I was enjoying it for them as well.\n\nThe latest race content, interviews, features, reviews and expert buying guides, direct to your inbox!\n\nHe added, \"Maybe some people would think the Giro was a safety net if I don’t succeed in the Tour de France, and for sure it would be if I didn’t succeed. To win the Tour de France is another level and to win both together is another level above that level! I’m really happy we did it.\"\n\nThe Slovenian took six stages to seal the 111th edition of this race to add to his victories in 2020 and 2021, and has become the first man since Marco Pantani 2026 to claim the elusive double of Giro d’Italia and Tour de France. \n\nHe joins an illustrious list including Eddy Merckx, Fausto Coppi, Jacques Anquetil, Bernard Hinault, and Miguel Indurain, and his dominance of men’s cycling – and rivalry with Jonas Vingegaard – looks set to continue for some time. \n\nThis was the first time trial to close the Tour since the infamous 1989 edition, when Greg Lemond took yellow from Laurent Fignon by just eight seconds. \n\nThis Tour has been a more straightforward affair – an imperious romp through Italy and France by Tadej Pogačar – and with the top three on GC sewn up for some time, the drama of today’s stage was confined to potential changes in the minor placings. In the end, there was only one change, as Santiago Buitrago (Bahrain Victorious) replaced Giulio Ciccone in the top 10.\n\nAfter one of the most brutal Tours de France in living memory, the riders couldn’t even enjoy the usual processional stage and sprint on the iconic Champs-Élysées in Paris, with the capital gearing up to host the Olympics next week. \n\nInstead they tackled a 33.7km individual time trial from Monaco to Nice. Unlike stage 7’s flatter ITT won by Remco Evenepoel, this was one final tough day in the saddle to draw this Tour to a close.\n\nOnly one categorised climb was on the menu – the 8.1km, 5.7% category 2 La Turbie, coming almost straight after the start – but that was quickly followed by another spiteful uphill drag in the Col d’Èze, which reaches highs of 13% near the peak. As well as the biting gradients the riders also had to contend with some technical descending and the threat of rain on an overcast day in the Côte d’Azur.   \n\nDavide Ballerini (Astana-Qazaqstan) was the first down the ramp, followed soon after by teammate Mark Cavendish, riding his last-ever Tour de France stage. The Manx Missile was all smiles at the start, hugging race director Christian Prudhomme and setting off to huge cheers. \n\nHe high-fived and waved to the crowds throughout the route before celebrating with his wife and children, who greeted him with shouts of ‘Dad, you did it!’ at the finish line as he brought the curtain down on a glittering Tour de France career. \n\nPerhaps appropriately for a rider who navigated the race’s time cut so expertly he finished 1.28,02 down on Ballerini to displace his teammate as lanterne rouge in his final and 15th Tour. The Manxman was asked, \"Is this the last race?” following his ride and after a long, expectant pause replied, \"Likely so, yeah.\" \n\nAnother history-maker but at the opposite end of his career, Biniam Girmay (Intermarché-Wanty) set off in head-to-toe green and on a special metallic green bike. He too waved to the crowds and was cheered over the line by his waiting teammates as he cemented the points classification, becoming the first African rider to claim the coveted green jersey. \n\nRichard Carapaz (EF Education-EasyPost) sealed the mountains classification on stage 20 and was also awarded the supercombativity prize, but with both victories sewn up he rolled around the course in relaxed fashion.\n\nLenny Martinez (Groupama-FDJ) was the first of the GC riders to set off, and was clearly determined to redeem his disappointing Tour. He set the fastest time at all the checkpoints, atop both the climbs and on the flat Place Île de Beauté 5km from the line, and demolished the best early time. \n\nThe Frenchman finished in 48.24,46 – 2.59,45 faster than the previous fastest, Matej Mohoric (Bahrain Victorious). Some early threats to that time were nullified: compatriot and stage 2 winner Kévin Vauquelin went into provisional second, 0.57,70 behind him, while stage 18 winner Victor Campenaerts was just 0.13,93 off the pace. \n\nThe Frenchman remained in the hot seat until Harold Tejada (Astana-Qazaqstan) produced a blistering turn on the descent from Col d’Èze. The Colombian turned around a 0.36,68 deficit at the second time check, on the uncategorised rise, into an 0.09,93 advantage at the finish to cross the line in 48.14,53.\n\nIt was an emotional day for several riders competing their final Tour de France: former stage winner Simon Geschke (Cofidis) waved and kissed goodbye to the crowds, as did home favourite and victor on stage 1, Romain Bardet. \n\n\n\nTejada continued to sit in the hot seat but all was about to change as the top 10 rolled down the ramp. Eighth-placed Matteo Jorgenson (Visma-Lease a Bike) hit the deck, losing a couple of seconds as he slipped off his bike on an early hairpin in Monaco, but the American was straight back up and riding again. \n\nDerek Gee, ninth overall, went eight seconds faster than Martinez at the first checkpoint and six seconds faster at the Col d’Èze, but his lead was short-lived as the top three each demonstrated their class. \n\nEvenepoel cruised through 36 seconds faster atop La Turbie, before Vingegaard stamped his authority further on his battle with the Belgian, 19 seconds faster in 20.17. And perhaps unsurprisingly, Pogačar went through another seven seconds faster. \n\nAt the second checkpoint Evenepoel was 46 seconds quicker than Gee, but Vingegaard stamped on the pedals to add another 26,89 to his lead, and Pogačar went another 25 seconds faster to indicate that this was no Champs-Élysées procession for the champion-elect. \n\nThe top three flew down the descents and as soon as Vingegaard replaced Evenepoel in the virtual lead, the imperious maillot jaune was crossing the line, celebrating a dominant third Tour victory and a 12th Grand Tour stage this year. He was congratulated by his rivals, mobbed by teammates, and has already set his sights on his next target.\n\n“[Mathieu] van der Poel looks really good in the world champion’s jersey but I want to take it from him! I want one time to have the rainbow jersey on my back, but I still have time for that,” he told reporters. \n\n“I think in the last two years we’ve been hearing that this is the best era of cycling. This kind of competition with Remco, Jonas, Primož [Roglič] is just incredible and the young guys that are coming more and more. It’s beautiful, in my opinion.”\n\n1.

        "expanded content": "PARIS — A year ago, the head of the Paris Olympics boldly declared that France’s capital would be “ the safest place in the world ” when the Games open this Friday. Tony Estanguet’s confident forecast looks less far-fetched now with squadrons of police patrolling Paris’ streets, fighter jets and soldiers primed to scramble, and imposing metal-fence security barriers erected like an iron curtain on both sides of the River Seine that will star in the opening show.\n\nFrance’s vast police and military operation is in large part because the July 26-Aug. 11 Games face unprecedented security challenges. The city has repeatedly suffered deadly extremist attacks and international tensions are high because of the wars in Ukraine and Gaza.\n\nRather than build an Olympic park with venues grouped together outside of the city center, like Rio de Janeiro in 2016 or London in 2012, Paris has chosen to host many of the events in the heart of the bustling capital of 2 million inhabitants, with others dotted around suburbs that house millions more. Putting temporary sports arenas in public spaces and the unprecedented choice to stage a river-borne opening ceremony stretching for kilometers (miles) along the Seine, makes safeguarding them more complex.\n\nOlympic organizers also have cyberattack concerns, while rights campaigners and Games critics are worried about Paris’ use of AI-equipped surveillance technology and the broad scope and scale of Olympic security.\n\nParis, in short, has a lot riding on keeping 10,500 athletes and millions of visitors safe. Here’s how it aims to do it.\n\nThe security operation, by the numbers:\n\nA Games-time force of up to 45,000 police and gendarmes is also backed up by a 10,000-strong contingent of soldiers that has set up the largest military camp in Paris since World War II, from which soldiers should be able to reach any of the city’s Olympic venues within 30 minutes.\n\nArmed military patrols aboard vehicles and on foot have become common in crowded places in France since gunmen and suicide bombers acting in the names of al-Qaida and the Islamic State group repeatedly struck Paris in 2015. They don’t have police powers of arrest but can tackle attackers and restrain them until police arrive. For visitors from countries where armed street patrols aren’t the norm, the sight of soldiers with assault rifles might be jarring, just as it was initially for people in France.\n\n“At the beginning, it was very strange for them to see us and they were always avoiding our presence, making a detour,” said Gen. Éric Chasboeuf, deputy commander of the counter-terror military force, called Sentinelle.\n\n“Now, it’s in the landscape,” he said.\n\nRafale fighter jets, airspace-monitoring AWACS surveillance flights, Reaper surveillance drones, helicopters that can carry sharpshooters, and equipment to disable drones will police Paris skies, which will be closed during the opening ceremony by a no-fly zone extending for 150 kilometers (93 miles) around the capital. Cameras twinned with artificial intelligence software — authorized by a law that expands the state’s surveillance powers for the Games — will flag potential security risks, such as abandoned packages or crowd surges,\n\nFrance is also getting help from more than 40 countries that, together, have sent at least 1,900 police reinforcements.\n\nAttacks by lone individuals are major concern, a risk driven home most recently to French officials by the assassination attempt against Donald Trump.\n\nSome involved in the Olympic security operation were stunned that the gunman armed with an AR-style rifle got within range of the former U.S. president.\n\n“No one can guarantee that there won’t be mistakes. There, however, it was quite glaring,” said Gen. Philippe Pourqué, who oversaw the construction of a temporary camp in southeast Paris housing 4,500 soldiers from the Sentinelle force.\n\nIn France, in the last 13 months alone, men acting alone have carried out knife attacks that targeted tourists in Paris, and children in a park in an Alpine town, among others. A man who stabbed a teacher to death at his former high school in northern France in October had been under surveillance by French security services for suspected Islamic radicalization.\n\nWith long and bitter experience of deadly extremist attacks, France has armed itself with a dense network of police units, intelligence services and investigators who specialize in fighting terrorism, and suspects in terrorism cases can be held longer for questioning.\n\nHundreds of thousands of background checks have scrutinized Olympic ticket-holders, workers and others involved in the Games and applicants for passes to enter Paris’ most tightly controlled security zone, along the Seine’s banks. The checks blocked more than 3,900 people from attending, Interior Minister Gerald Darmanin said. He said some were flagged for suspected Islamic radicalization, left- or right-wing political extremism, significant criminal records and other security concerns.\n\n“We’re particularly attentive to Russian and Belorussian citizens,” Darmanin added, although he stopped short of linking exclusions to Russia’s war in Ukraine and Belarus’ role as an ally of Moscow.\n\nDarmanin said 155 people considered to be “very dangerous” potential terror threats are also being kept away from the opening ceremony and the Games, with police searching their homes for weapons and computers in some cases.\n\nHe said intelligence services haven’t identified any proven terror plots against the Games “but we are being extremely attentive.”\n\nCritics fear intrusive Olympic security will stay after the Games\n\nCampaigners for digital rights worry that Olympic surveillance cameras and AI systems could erode privacy and other freedoms, and zero in on people without fixed homes who spend a lot of time in public spaces.\n\nSaccage 2024, a group that has campaigned for months against the Paris Games, took aim at the scope of the Olympic security, describing it as a “repressive arsenal” in a statement to The Associated Press.\n\n“And this is not a French exception, far from it, but a systematic occurrence in host countries,” it said. “Is it reasonable to offer one month of ‘festivities’ to the most well-off tourists at the cost of a long-term securitization legacy for all residents of the city and the country?”\n\nAdvertisement"

(AP Photo/Kin Cheung)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSouth Sudan is the 33rd-ranked team in the FIBA world rankings, by far the lowest of any of the 12 nations that will be vying for men’s basketball gold in the Paris Olympics that start this week.\n\nThe U.S. is ranked No. 1.\n\nSouth Sudan nearly beat the Americans anyway.\n\nThe every-four-years wake-up call for the U.S. Olympic team seems to have arrived. A 101-100 win over South Sudan on Saturday in London came on a day when plenty went wrong for the Americans — traffic getting to the arena was brutal and Anthony Davis said arriving late threw off players’ routines, South Sudan shot lights-out from 3-point range and outscored the U.S. 42-21 from deep and the U.S. struggled in plenty of aspects.\n\nAnd it all serves as a reminder that at the Olympics, there are no guarantees anymore. Not even for the four-time defending gold medalists, a program that lost two exhibitions on the way to Tokyo in 2021 and then lost to France to open those Games before rallying to win gold at the end.\n\n“There’s great teams all over the place and nothing is guaranteed at this point for USA Basketball,” U.S. coach Steve Kerr said earlier this summer. “We know that well, I know it personally. We won the gold medal in Tokyo, but we lost three games along the way. Our gold-medal game against France went right down to the wire. So, this is an entirely different competition than it was in 1992.”\n\nThere was no doubt who was winning gold in 1992: The first U.S. Dream Team overpowered every team in its path. Chuck Daly coached a roster that included 11 future members of the Basketball Hall of Fame; Kerr loves relaying the story that Daly never had to call a timeout that whole summer, because no game was ever in any sort of jeopardy.\n\n\n\n\nKerr had to call one on Saturday with 20 seconds left to get LeBron James the ball and set up what became the winning, embarrassment-saving basket for the one-point win against South Sudan, a nation that gained its independence only 13 years ago, is set to make its Olympic debut and doesn’t have a suitable indoor facility for national team-level basketball training.\n\n“A lot of these teams we’re playing have been practicing either one month or months in advance,” James said. “We’re like maybe two weeks into it, together. So, every game, every film session, every opportunity we have to try to make the most of it.”\n\nThe last tuneup, the last pre-Olympic test, the last measuring stick of sorts for the U.S., comes Monday in London, where the Americans take on Germany. The U.S. is favored by 15.5 points, according to BetMGM Sportsbook, over the reigning World Cup champions and team that beat the Americans in that tournament’s semifinals a year ago in Manila. That was of no relevance Saturday, when the U.S. was 43.5-point favorites against South Sudan.\n\nBut if all the warmup games around the world this summer have been any indication, then this whole Olympic tournament could be wide open.\n\nSouth Sudan lost to Argentina and barely beat Britain, two teams that didn’t even qualify for the Olympics — then nearly knocked off the U.S. The Americans beat Australia, which beat Serbia, which beat France, which went 1-1 against Germany; the French win came with the Germans playing without brothers Franz and Moritz Wagner and the French loss came without Victor Wembanyama in the lineup.\n\n“We’ve got a great 12 guys,” U.S. guard Stephen Curry said. “Basketball is such an interesting sport that if you don’t play the right way, if you don’t come with the right energy and the right focus to go play defense, rebound, not turn the ball over, you can be beat. It doesn’t matter who you’re playing. So, it’s a good reminder of that.”\n\nSaturday was also a good reminder of this: Nobody seems intimidated by the U.S. Not even 17-year-olds.\n\nA couple of weeks after Cooper Flagg put on a show against the Olympic team at training camp in Las Vegas, a fellow Duke freshman — South Sudan’s Khaman Maluach — found himself going up against his big-man idols on Saturday in Bam Adebayo, Joel Embiid and Davis.\n\nJust like Flagg did in Vegas, Maluach more than held his own, scoring seven points in 13 minutes on 3-for-4 shooting.\n\n“Matching up with them was something I couldn’t imagine,” Maluach told Eurohoops after the game. “It was just in my head, ‘Oh, I’m playing against these guys?’”\n\nAn 18-0 run in the second half, a burst that started during a third quarter in which the U.S. outscored South Sudan 37-18, was the difference for the Americans. James made a layup to save his team at the end, and what was supposed to be a meaningless game sure seemed to have a whole lot of meaning.\n\n“We can be beat if we don’t play our brand of basketball and our brand of basketball is playing defense,” Curry said. “They made some tough shots in the first half and they’re a skilled team with a lot of shooting, so if they get hot, they’re tough. But we didn’t make them uncomfortable at all in the first half and they took advantage of it.\n\n“But we also learned we have that gear. If we can find it, no matter who’s out there on the court, we can overwhelm teams for 40 minutes. And it’s a great reminder of both. If we don’t play our game, we can be beat. We’re not invincible.”\n\n___\n\nAP Summer Olympics: https://apnews.com/hub/2024-paris-olympic-games\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCopyright 2025 The Associated Press. All Rights Reserved."

Inset: Jack (left) and Tan Bin Shen posing with their silver medals at the World Junior Championships in 2002.\n\nFROM smashing shuttlecocks on the court to developing young gems - this is the journey of former international Datuk Jack Koh after retiring from competitive play.\n\nThe fence in front of Jack’s house once served as his arena where he would challenge his elder brother James every evening until his talent was discovered by Yap Kim Hock’s father Yap Beng Tong.\n\nThis was the turning point in Jack’s life as he trained under Beng Tong and never looked back, eventually joining Bukit Jalil Sports School (BJSS) and donning the national colours in 2001.\n\nBeng Tong’s rigorous training regime and dedication in bringing Jack and the other players to different states to challenge older and stronger players laid the foundation for Jack’s early success in the sport.\n\n“Uncle Yap was a rare gem for us Muarian badminton players,” said Jack, who partnered Ong Soon Hock to win the silver medal in the Asean Junior Championships in 2001 before winning gold in the team event and a bronze medal in the men’s doubles in 2002.\n\n“He only charged my parents RM30 per month for training, and he would pick me up and drop me home five times a week for training at the nearby community hall.\n\n“Often, his car would be filled with up to 10 kids, all eager to improve their skills.\n\n“He always emphasised on giving our best and playing to win.\n\n“If we lost, he encouraged us to take it as a learning experience to become better in the next round.\n\n“In 1997-1998, I caught the attention of BAM (Badminton Association of Malaysia), thanks to Mr. How Kim Thou and coach Koay Kar Lin during a tournament hosted in Larkin, Johor.\n\n“Reflecting back before I stepped into my Ruby Jubilee, I wonder where I would be without the sport of badminton.\n\n“It has truly shaped me into the person I am today and played a pivotal role in my journey.”\n\nJack found himself at a crossroads, unsure of what the future held for him after tendering his resignation and leaving the BAM with no clear plan.\n\nHowever, Jack’s resignation turned out to be a blessing in disguise as he transitioned to a behind-the-scenes role after his squad mate, Dixson Lai, who is also the elder brother of independent mixed doubles shuttler Shevon Lai, connected him with Malaysia’s badminton godfather Looi Suk.\n\nIn 2006, Jack started working at Choong Wen School badminton hall, an initial step that led to a partnership culminating in the founding of the Looi Badminton Academy.This academy later evolved into the Petaling Badminton Club (BC) and ultimately led to the establishment of Sports Arena Sentosa in 2011.\n\nPetaling BC shone in their mission as a feeder club to supply talents for the national team and have already produced four current stars – world champions Aaron Chia and Soh Wooi Yik, Olympian Chen Tang Jie and Man Wei Chong.\n\n“My unexpected departure from BAM marked the beginning of a remarkable chapter in my life, guided by the unwavering support of mentors like Looi Suk and visionaries like KH Lim,” said Jack, who is the chief executive officer of Petaling BC.\n\n“If Uncle Yap is a rare gem, Looi Suk is a sapphire among gems in the badminton world.\n\n“His selfless dedication and unwavering commitment to the sport exemplify a philosophy of giving without expecting anything in return.\n\n“This ethos extends not only to me but also to distinguished figures such as Choong Tan Fook, Lee Chong Wei, Aaron, Wei Chong, and many others who have benefited from his mentorship.\n\n“In 2010, we embarked on a groundbreaking initiative by co-founding SS Talent with KH Lim, the visionary and benefactor behind the project.\n\n“Our mission was clear: to nurture Malaysia’s next badminton superstar through a comprehensive talent development programme.\n\n“Over the course of three years, we organised the SS Junior competitions and offered full-time scholarships to 10 promising athletes selected and coached by the esteemed Cheah Soon Kit.\n\n“As the programme evolved, Yap Kim Hock took the reins, guiding the SS Talent cohort towards their ultimate goal of graduating into the national team BAM in 2017.”\n\nJack co-founded Malaysia’s first professional league named Malaysia Purple League in 2014, which previously featured a lot of star players like Chong Wei, Japan’s Kento Momota and Lee Yong-dae of South Korea before its format was revamped to focus more on the grassroots level.\n\nAnother successful initiative from Jack and the team was the NCT National Junior Badminton Championships last month where four lucky winners – Mohd Noor Hanafi (boys’ doubles Under-13), Chong Wan Xin (girls’ singles Under-13), Lim Zheng Jie (boys’ singles Under-15) and Teoh Sue Mei (girls’ singles Under-15) – get to watch their idols in action in the Paris Olympics.“The Purple League serves as a platform in our own backyard for public private partnership with clubs’ ecosystem to thrive by providing high quality league competition opportunities for top juniors to go head on with top ranked national players,” said Jack.\n\n \n\nThank you for

I'm so happy.\n\n\"(Five stages) is more than enough. One would be enough. Just the yellow jersey would be enough. But it is how it is, you don't brake in cycling.\"\n\nPogačar attacked from the leading duo with 150m remaining and beat Vingegaard by seven seconds.\n\nIt will likely be the same positions on the final podium after Pogačar extended his lead to 5 minutes, 14 seconds, over two-time defending champ Vingegaard, his closest rival.\n\nThird-placed Remco Evenepoel lost even more time. He crossed the line in fourth — behind Richard Carapaz — and lost 53 seconds to Pogačar to fall 8:04 behind the Slovenian star.\n\nThe Tour ends tonight on the French Riviera with a 34km time trail from Monaco to Nice, and not in Paris as it usually does because of the Olympic Games.\n\nBarring incident, Pogačar is almost certain to reclaim the Tour crown from Vingegaard and in doing so secure a rare Giro d'Italia and Tour de France double. The last rider to win both in the same year was the late Marco Pantani in 1998.\n\n\"I enjoyed (the stage) very much,\" Pogačar said. \n\n\"It didn't go as we planned, but I couldn't be happier with that, another stage win. Just one more day … and tomorrow I think I'm going to enjoy it as well.\"\n\nABC Sport is live blogging every day of the Paris Olympics\n\nABC Sport is live blogging every day of the Paris Olympics\n\nAfter his explosive attack the previous day, Pogačar said he would not try to win the stage, a short but brutal 133km route from Nice that featured three hard category 1 ascents.\n\nIndeed, the UAE Emirates rider just stayed with the rest of the reduced group of title contenders on the daunting 16km ramp up the Col de la Couillole until Vingegaard made his move and Pogačar sat on the Dane's wheel.\n\nABC Sport Daily is your daily sports conversation. We dive into the biggest story of the day and get you up to speed with everything else that's making headlines.\n\nThey then swept up the remnants of the breakaway and caught up to the front two of Carapaz and Enric Mas with 2.5km remaining.\n\nFirst Mas and then Carapaz were dropped, setting up an intriguing battle in the final kilometre between the two cycling stars but it was only a matter of time before Pogačar launched his sprint.\n\nMoments after crossing the line, Pogačar pulled up and waited for Vingegaard to embrace him.\n\nVingegaard was hospitalised for nearly two weeks in April following a high-speed crash in the Tour of the Basque Country. He resumed competitive racing only on this Tour.\n\n\"In some kind of way I was hoping he would give it to me,\" Vingegaard said. \n\n\"But I knew already that I had been riding so hard, if he would sprint I would have no chance as I was already on my limit.\n\n\"But you can always hope. But it's cycling, that's how it is. I don't blame him at all, I would do probably the same. I'm just happy with how I performed today and how I could come back from yesterday.\"\n\nAP\n\nTopic:NRL\n\nTopic:Paralympic Games\n\nTopic:Sport\n\nTopic:Police\n\nTopic:State of Origin\n\nTopic:Health\n\nAnalysis by Patricia Karvelas\n\nTopic:Foreign Aid\n\nTopic:Alternative Energy\n\nTopic:Courts\n\nTopic:Royalty\n\nTopic:Health\n\nTopic:Foreign Aid\n\nCycle Sport\n\nFrance\n\nRoad Cycle Racing\n\nSport\n\nTopic:Health\n\nAnalysis by Patricia Karvelas\n\nTopic:Foreign Aid\n\nTopic:Alternative Energy\n\nTopic:Courts\n\nTopic:World War 2\n\nTopic:Children's Health\n\nTopic:Activism and Lobbying\n\nTopic:Indigenous Culture\n\nWe acknowledge Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples as the First Australians and Traditional Custodians of the lands where we live, learn, and work.\n\nThis service may include material from Agence France-Presse (AFP), APTN, Reuters, AAP, CNN and the BBC World Service which is copyright and cannot be reproduced.\n\nAEST = Australian Eastern Standard Time which is 10 hours ahead of GMT (Greenwich Mean Time)"

        "expanded content": "The International Olympic Committee (IOC) has said its IT systems are robust after going into meltdown on Friday as a result of the CrowdStrike outage and despite fears of a Russian cyber-attack at the Paris 2024 Games.\n\nAccording to sources, the IOC’s chief technical officer was woken up at 2am Paris time after the botched CrowdStrike update, that affected 8.5m Windows devices. The IOC was able to secure a priority fix with the American company, which meant its systems were back online on Friday. Before then, security checks at the Games’ press centre were done manually using lists of names and the accreditation desk was closed.\n\nMark Adams, the IOC president’s spokesman, said: “There were some significant problems on Friday morning but it was dealt with. I’m not a technology expert but I would say it was quite a good rehearsal for the Games.\n\n“Cyber-attacks are part of everyone’s daily life nowadays. There are phishing attempts everywhere. And the Olympic Games is a huge target. Needless to say, we have a huge amount of safeguards in place. We have been assured by our people, and by partners and Paris 2024, that we are very, very prepared.”\n\nRussia successfully hacked the opening ceremony of the 2018 Winter Olympics. “You can never be too prepared,” Adams said. “But we had a pretty close call in Pyeongchang, so we have experience, we know what we’re looking for. As far as we can, we have every confidence we know how to deal with it.”\n\nAdams confirmed no efforts had been made to contact the Russian authorities and ask them not to target the Games with cyber-attacks. “Clearly there is a campaign of some sort going on,” he said. “It’s not the first time or the last time that the IOC became the target of misinformation. You’ll see it very clearly, particularly with the Tom Cruise film, it is getting more and more sophisticated.”\n\nThe IOC has ruled that some Russian athletes could compete at the Paris Games as neutrals, as long as they had no connections with the military. As a result 15 Russians and 17 Belarusians will be in Paris but will take part without flags, emblems or the anthems of their country. However, the Russian government has regularly criticised the IOC, and last year a Russian hacking group, Storm-1679, also released a video on Telegram called “Olympics Has Fallen,” using AI-generated voice purporting to be the Hollywood actor Tom Cruise. The IOC’s president, Thomas Bach, was also targeted by hoax phone calls from a Russian group pretending to be the African Union Commission.\n\nSign up to Olympic and Paralympic briefing\n\nOur daily email briefing will help you keep up with all the goings on at the Olympics and Paralympics \n\nafter newsletter promotion\n\nElsewhere, the IOC promised that there would be “some pretty heavy duty safeguarding going on” after Dutch volleyball decided to pick a convicted rapist for the Paris Games. Steven van de Velde was sentenced to four years in prison in Britain in 2016 after the rape of a 12-year-old girl two years earlier when he was 19. “I also believe the athlete is not staying in the village,” added Adams.\n\nThis is the archive of The Observer up until 21/04/2025.

Many countries have already shared the outfits for the opening and closing ceremonies, with Mongolia and Haiti earning praise for their team’s looks.\n\nOn July 17, Thailand’s outfits were revealed, modeled by badminton competitor “Popor“ Sapsiree Taerattanachai. The uniform is made from recycled fabric made from plastic bottles and features a traditional pattern. \n\nThe outfits, which present a formal image, were met with very mixed reactions. Many found them lacking and “dated” compared to other nations’ outfits, with renowned Thai architect and artist Duangrit Bunnag commenting, “All my friends complained last night. So sad.”\n\nThai social media hasn't taken too kindly to Team Thailand's uniform for the upcoming Olympic opening ceremony: a traditional \"chut thai\".

        "expanded content": "Swiss company On will make history in Paris and is challenging the sneaker superbrands\n\nHellen Obiri, the Kenyan long-distance runner, is a hot prospect for the Olympics this month. That is not only down to a talent that has seen her take two silver medals previously and a win at the Boston Marathon in April – but also her shoes.\n\nIn Paris, Obiri will wear the Cloudboom Strike LS. This innovative design made by Swiss sneaker brand On using what they call LightSpray technology will be released to the public this autumn.\n\nTo produce each shoe, a robotic arm holds a foot-shaped last as thermoplastic polyurethane is sprayed in a continuous string, coalescing into a rubbery textile shoe. The resulting design has no laces but a bulbous sole to absorb impact. The women’s shoes weigh just 158 grams (5.5oz) making them more aerodynamic – even if they look a little unusual\n\nObiri was initially sceptical. “The first time I saw the shoes, I said, ‘No,’” she told the New York Times. “‘I can’t run with these.’” After winning in Boston, however, On reported she wouldn’t give the shoes back.\n\nThis is great publicity for the brand, but it’s actually just the latest example of how On is booming. At the last Olympics in 2021, few sneakerheads would have heard of this young Swiss brand, but in 2024 chunky-soled styles like their Cloudmonster have become huge hits. Selling in stores in 60 countries around the world, the company’s net sales for 2023 reached CHF1.79bn (£1.56bn), and grew 47% from 2022.\n\nOn’s rise is also part of a wider change in the world of sneaker megabrands. Nike – once almost untouchable – is struggling and forecasts that sales will drop by up to 9% by May 2025, its worst performance for 26 years. Despite strong sales thanks to the popular Samba, Adidas is still offloading Yeezy shoes left after it terminated its partnership with rapper and designer Kanye West because of his antisemitic tirades. The German company also had to pull ads featuring model Bella Hadid last week after criticism by the Israeli government. The pro-Palestinian model was advertising a sports shoe originally launched during the 1972 Olympics, an event at which 11 Israelis were killed in a Palestinian terrorist attack.\n\n“The sneaker market as a whole is in flux,” said Jake Bell, a New York marketing consultant. “Consumers are looking to brands doing new, interesting things.”\n\nOn was founded in Zurich by Olivier Bernhard, David Allemann and Caspar Coppetti in 2010. The patented CloudTec technology was their unique innovation. It cushions the foot and allows a softer landing and better “push-off” during runs. It was this that convinced the brand to take on the likes of Nike and Adidas.\n\n“Most people thought they were crazy to enter an industry with such well established, global megabrands as competitors,” said chief marketing officer, Alex Griffin. “However [our founders] were confident they had something special.”\n\nAs well as Obiri, On made a shoe with Roger Federer (the tennis champion invested in the brand in 2019) and they will provide the uniforms for the Swiss team at the Paris Olympics.\n\nBut they also work with names that appeal to the fashionable consumer. They have partnered with luxury brand Loewe on collections and actor Zendaya and singer FKA twigs – both recent Vogue cover stars – feature in their campaigns.\n\nDaniel-Yaw Miller, of the Business of Fashion website, says this mixture is essential: “They don’t separate influencers, tastemakers and ambassadors,” he said. “Everyone’s part of the same thing.” Marketing consultant Bell, a keen runner, said: “Whether it’s running in Central Park, the West Side Highway, or on the treadmill at Equinox, I am seeing more and more runners wearing On.I’ve heard great things about their proprietary cushioning system, which helps lower shock absorption.”\n\nLydia Sanders, co-founder of Runner Beans Club, a group in south-east London, said: “In the last six months, more people are wearing them. The Cloudmonster is popular. They could be influenced by seeing other people wearing them in the club.”\n\nMiller thinks On is now a key competitor to the big brands: “The reason On is still growing at an astronomical rate is because people are adopting it more as their everyday shoe. You can exercise in the morning and you don’t need to take other footwear with you. That’s what they’ve sold.”\n\nThis is the archive of The Observer up until 21/04/2025.

It was an epic showdown featuring the league's top stars, which included rookie sensations Caitlin Clark and Angel Reese, and Team USA superstars A'ja Wilson and Breanna Stewart.    \n\nAt the end of the night, however, one star shined the brightest — and that was Dallas Wings superstar Arike Ogunbowale, who put on a scintillating performance.\n\nOgunbowale dropped 34 points to set the record for the most points scored in a WNBA All-Star game. With her record-setting night, it's only right to update this list. With that said, here are the five most points recorded in WNBA All-Star Game history.\n\nArike Ogunbuwale seems to enjoy going up against the USA Women's Olympic Basketball team. The last time the league pitted 12 of the WNBA's top stars against the National Team, Ogunbowale also led Team WNBA to a win by scoring 26 points on 10-of-18 shooting from the field and 5-of-10 from beyond the arc.\n\nFast-forward to three years later, the Dallas Wings guard one-upped that performance with the greatest show ever put on display in the WNBA All-Star Game. \n\nArike Ogunbowale - 2024 WNBA All-Star Game\n\nCategory\n\nStats\n\nPTS\n\n34\n\nREB\n\n3\n\nAST\n\n6\n\nFGM-A\n\n10-20\n\n3PM-A\n\n8-13\n\nFor a while there, it seemed like Ogunbowale would have a forgettable evening. She went scoreless in the first half, missing her mere two attempts before the intermission.\n\nBut as soon as the second half started, the four-time All-Star turned on the heater and wowed the Footprint Center crowd in Phoenix with an incredible display of offense and shooting. She scored 21 of her 34 second half points in the third quarter, draining five three-pointers in the period. \n\nShe ultimately set the record after draining this tough step-back three-pointer over Jackie Young and Breanna Stewart late in the fourth quarter.\n\nTo nobody's surprise, Ogunbowale won the 2024 WNBA All-Star Game MVP award, the second of her career.\n\nJewell Loyd set the WNBA All-Star Game scoring record just over a year ago when she dropped 31 points and won MVP honors to lead Team Stewart to a 143-127 win over Team Wilson.\n\n\nThe electric                             Seattle Storm\n\n guard has always been a certified bucket-getter throughout her decade-long WNBA career.    \n\nLoyd wasn't shy about letting that ball fly at all, as all of her 31 points in that game came from beyond the arc. She connected on a record 10 long distance shots, including a four-pointer, which was a special feature introduced during the 2022 iteration of the game.\n\n31 point performances - WNBA All-Star Game\n\nCategory\n\nJewell Loyd, 2023\n\nBreanna Stewart, 2024\n\nPTS\n\n31\n\n31\n\nFGM-A\n\n10-22\n\n10-21\n\n3PM-A\n\n10-21\n\n3-9\n\nREB\n\n4\n\n10\n\nAST\n\n6\n\n3\n\nLoyd averaged 25.7 points prior to the All-Star Game and finished the season averaging 24.7 points to win the 2023 scoring title. That's why it came to nobody's surprise that she went off during the league's showcase of stars.\n\nLoyd's former Storm teammate Breanna Stewart joined her in the record books after tallying 31 points in Team USA's losing effort to Team WNBA in the 2024 All-Star Game. Though the night belonged to Ogunbowale, Stewart also had a stellar performance to lead the National Team.\n\n\nThe                             New York Liberty\n\n star finished with 14 points in the first half, then scored 13 of her 17 second half points in the fourth quarter.    \n\n\n Only three players have scored at least 30 points in a WNBA All-Star Game and                             Las Vegas Aces\n\n star Kelsey Plum has done it twice. In fact, she has done it for two years in a row now and is aiming for a third straight while representing Team USA in the 2024 WNBA All-Star Game.    \n\nPlum has become one of the most exciting scorers in the league, so it's not shocking to her her thrive in an All-Star game setting. Her first 30-piece came in a winning effort when she led Team Wilson, captained by her Las Vegas teammate A'ja Wilson, to a 134-112 win over Team Stewart.\n\nPlum dropped another 30-ball the next year. However, it came in a losing effort this time around, with Team Stewart coming out on top thanks to Jewell Loyd's record-setting performance.\n\n30-point performances - WNBA All-Star Game\n\nCategory\n\nMaya Moore, 2015\n\nKelsey Plum, 2022\n\nKelsey Plum, 2023\n\nPTS\n\n30\n\n30\n\n30\n\nFGM-A\n\n10-16\n\n12-18\n\n11-17\n\n3PM-A\n\n6-10\n\n5-11\n\n6-10\n\nREB\n\n6\n\n2\n\n1\n\nAST\n\n5\n\n3\n\n5\n\n\nMeanwhile, the other 30-point All-Star game performance came from four-time WNBA champion Maya Moore in 2015. The former                             Minnesota Lynx\n\n superstar made 10-of-16 field goals and drained six three-pointers in just 20 minutes to set the WNBA All-Star game scoring record at the time.    \n\nShe earned her first of three straight WNBA All-Star Game MVPs that day, subsequently bagging the 2017 and 2018 trophies (there was no All-Star Game in 2016 due to the Summer Olympics).\n\nMoore walked away from the game in her prime \"to focus on her family and ministry dreams.\" Though she may have left basketball early to pursue her other passions in life, Moore's standing as one of the all-time greats is firmly secured.\n\n The 2014 WNBA All-Star Game was arguably one of the most exhilarating All-Star games in league history — and rookie Shoni Schimmel wound up becoming the star of the show. Schimmel set a then-record 29 points to lead the East to a thrilling 125-124 victory over the West, outdueling fellow All-Star guard, Skylar Diggins-Smith.\n\n\nDespite coming off the bench all season, the former                             Atlanta Dream\n\n guard became just the third reserve to be voted as a starter in the WNBA All-Star game. She certainly showed why she deserved to be there as she gave the fans a treat with one of the most memorable performances in WNBA All-Star game history.    \n\n\nUnfortunately, Schimmel wasn't able to capitalize on her early career success. She wound up playing just 85 career games in the WNBA. Despite being an All-Star in her first two seasons with the Dream, her career went south after she was traded to the                             New York Liberty\n\n in the 2016 season.    \n\nShe had a significantly reduced role in New York and sat out the entire 2017 campaign due to personal issues. Her last appearance in the league was in 2018, where she played two games for the Las Vegas Aces.\n\nJonquel Jones tied Schimmel's mark in 2022 when she scored 29 points during Team Stewart's loss to Team Wilson. Then playing for the Connecticut Sun, the current New York Liberty center also hauled in 13 rebounds, went 11-of-20 from the field, and drained five triples in the losing effort.\n\n29-point Performances - WNBA All-Star Game\n\nCategory\n\nShoni Schimmel, 2014\n\nJonquel Jones, 2022\n\nPTS\n\n29\n\n29\n\nFGM-A\n\n11-24\n\n11-20\n\n3PM-A\n\n7-16\n\n5-10\n\nREB\n\n3\n\n13\n\nAST\n\n8\n\n5\n\nJones, now a five-time All-Star and the 2021 WNBA MVP, will be representing Team USA in the 2024 WNBA All-Star Game.\n\n Skylar Diggins-Smith made a big statement in her All-Star Game debut when she dropped 27 points in her epic duel with Schimmel in the 2014 WNBA All-Star Game. The two All-Star game debutants put on a show and traded haymakers late in the game.\n\n​​​​​Diggins-Smith, in particular, helped lead a fourth quarter comeback for the West to force overtime. She made a three-pointer during the extra session that momentarily gave her the record, before Schimmel made a couple more three-pointers to end the evening with the all-time mark, which was broken a year later by Maya Moore.\n\nThe East went on an 11-3 run to close the game as Diggins-Smith came up short in her efforts to lead the West to the victory.\n\nSkylar Diggins-Smith - 2014 WNBA All-Star Game\n\nCategory\n\nStats\n\nPTS\n\n27\n\nFGM-A\n\n10-18\n\n3PM-A\n\n4-7\n\nREB\n\n4\n\nAST\n\n7\n\nDiggins-Smith made the star-studded exhibition in just her sophomore season.

Despite helping lead the Seattle Storm to a 17-8 record — which is tied for the best record in the Western Conference with the Minnesota Lynx — Diggins-Smith was left off both Team USA and the WNBA All-Star roster this season.\n\nNonetheless, at 33 years old, Diggins-Smith remains a key contributor on a Storm team looking to bring the first championship to Seattle post the Breanna Stewart-Sue Bird era.\n\nCaitlin Clark just set the new record for assists in a single game with 19.

Here’s how it works.\n\n\nWas there ever any doubt? The Tour de France was already won, but that didn’t mean Tadej Pogačar was done winning at the Tour de France.\n\nWhen Pogačar approached the summit of the Col de la Couillole in the company of Jonas Vingegaard, it was tempting to wonder if the yellow jersey would quietly cede victory on stage 20 to his closest rival, to a man who had made such a speedy return from horrific injury to contest this Tour.\n\nVingegaard even wondered it himself, though the Visma-Lease a Bike rider must have known in his bones that Pogačar was never likely to pass up on the chance to hammer home his supremacy at this race, not after the stinging defeats suffered at the Dane’s hand these past two Julys.\n\nWhen Vingegaard attacked with 5km or so remaining, Pogačar had been content to follow, save for one, cursory turn on the front. He carefully tracked Vingegaard all the way to the final 450 metres, before he eased in front of him once again. Even then, it briefly looked as though Pogačar was merely putting a bow on a gift for his rival.\n\nNot a chance. A beat or two later, Pogačar accelerated forcefully, immediately opened a winning gap over Vingegaard, who could scarcely raise a gallop in response. The UAE Team Emirates rider crossed the line with arms stretched wide to celebrate his fifth stage victory at this Tour. No gifts.\n\nPogačar is nothing if not consistent. He helped himself to six stage victories and a winning margin of almost 10 minutes at the Giro d'Italia in May, so he was hardly liable to ease up at any point here.\n\nThe unwritten etiquette of leading a Grand Tour is just that, a nebulous concept. Pogačar, by contrast, has always subscribed to a Merckx-ian view of the world, advertising his personal terms and conditions in bold print. Every race is a race to be won, and this was his 19th of a stratospheric season, a year that defies all logic.\n\nThe latest race content, interviews, features, reviews and expert buying guides, direct to your inbox!\n\n“You don’t give away stages just to your closest competition, for sure not,” Pogačar said in his post-stage press conference. “We maybe gave the breakaway enough time today, they had a big chance, and they had big chance a lot of times.\n\n“But sprinters also don’t say ‘OK, today another sprint can win, I will back off a little bit'. It’s a sport where you want to win, where you need to win. You’re also paid to win. It’s a pressure and you need to deliver. Otherwise, it’s not good for you if you don’t deliver. You always need to go for the victory if you can.”\n\nAfter his crushing victory at Isola 2000 on Friday, Pogačar had shrugged off the already jaded idea of being the new cannibal, insisting that he had little interest in chasing stage victory the following day. That may or may not have been his intention when stage 20 began, but when circumstances put victory within his reach, he was never going to pass up the opportunity.\n\nThe forcing of Soudal-QuickStep, who were trying to tee up Evenepoel, kept the break within Pogačar’s orbit. When Vingegaard responded to Evenepoel’s attacks, Pogačar figured he might as well follow. And, once Vingegaard reeled in the last of the day’s escapees, Pogačar figured he might as well win.\n\n“Soudal decided to try to take some time on Jonas or maybe win the stage, which was really playing into my hands,” Pogačar said. \n\n“Remco did everything to drop Jonas and it was super hard to follow. When Remco attacked and Jonas countered, it was at the limit. I didn’t want to work with Jonas. I was happy to sit on his wheel and let Richard Carapaz and Enric Mas go for victory.”\n\nPogačar had already long since sealed overall victory at this Tour. In hindsight, the knock-out blows were dealt in the Pyrenees last weekend, though Vingegaard’s concession only arrived on the upper reaches of the Bonette on Friday.\n\nBy ripping clear to win on the Col de la Couillole, Pogačar has now extended his lead over Vingegaard to 5:14. Third-placed Evenepoel now trails by 8:04. Nobody else is within sixteen minutes of him. It has been a rout, and Pogačar may well pad his lead further in Sunday’s final time trial to Nice, which this year replaces the traditional lap of honour around the Champs-Élysées due to the Paris Olympics.\n\n“I mean, it’s definitely going to be different,” said Pogačar. “But I don’t like it, because I start so late, at 17.45 in the afternoon. It’s a long day just for a time trial, and it’s a hard one as well. I think I would prefer a Champs­-Élysées sprint.”\n\nPerhaps, but the 33.7km time trial from Monaco presents him with a clear chance to add a sixth stage victory on this Tour. In any case, Pogačar will claim his third overall victory on Sunday evening, sealing the first Giro-Tour double since 1998 in the process.\n\nThis latest Tour victory, Pogačar acknowledged, was different to the previous two. On his debut in 2020, when he snatched the prize from his compatriot Primož Roglič at the death, the yellow jersey came almost as a bonus. A year later, he had the race effectively wrapped up by the end of week one. This triumph, after two Julys being outshone by Vingegaard, has a different flavour.\n\n“I can talk here for a long time about all the three Tours,” Pogačar said. “In 2020, it was a surprise for everybody that I won, also for me. Back then, I would already have been happy with second. I was aiming for a stage win in last TT, but in the end, I won the whole thing.\n\n“In 2021 I had this one really good day in the Alps, one of my best days on the bike, when it was raining and full gas from start to finish. I gained a lot of time, so it was quite a tranquillo Tour de France to finish.”\n\nAnd the latest?\n\n“2021 could be close to compare to now, but I think this year’s is one level higher,” he said. “Plus I had much more pressure, and much more focus for the Tour after the two years when I couldn’t win. It’s different. We could compare and talk about it almost forever.”\n\nGet unlimited access to all of our coverage of the Tour de France - including breaking news and analysis reported by our journalists on the ground from every stage of the race as it happens and more.

She and her sister, Gigi, have attended marches, donated at least $1 million to aid groups for Palestinians, and spoken out against the killing of innocent Palestinian and Israeli civilians.\n\nWhile Hadid's ads have been pulled, the SL 72 shoes remain available for purchase on the Adidas site, which touts them as an \"archival favorite\" from the 1972 Munich Olympics.\n\n\"Introduced in 1972, SL 72 shoes and sneakers from Adidas revolutionized running for track-and-field athletes seeking speed and agility on the track,\" the company's website says.\n\nIsrael also criticized the campaign as a whole.

Women will be boxing at flyweight (50kg), bantamweight (54kg), featherweight (57kg), lightweight (60kg), welterweight (66kg), and middleweight (75kg).\n\nHistorically, the United States is an Olympic boxing powerhouse, having won more medals in the sport than any other nation, and by a significant margin. Since 1904, the Americans have won 117 medals, with Cuba in second place at 78, and Great Britain in third with 62.\n\nBut recent years have not been kind to the Team USA boxing program. No male boxer has won a gold medal for the country since Andre Ward in 2004. In 2008, the Americans won just one medal, a bronze by Deontay Wilder, and in 2012, the men won zero medals, with gold for Claressa Shields and bronze for Marlen Esparza on the brand new women’s side.\n\n2016 saw Shields repeat with a second gold, and the men got back on the podium with Shakur Stevenson winning a silver medal and Nico Hernandez a bronze. In Tokyo, Richard Torrez, Keyshawn Davis, and Duke Ragan all won silver, making for the most successful American men’s team in nearly two decades while still falling short of a gold, and Oshae Jones won bronze on the women’s side.\n\nFeatherweight Jahmal Harvey is seen as the nation’s best hope at its first men’s gold medal since Ward in Athens, when the 21-year-old Harvey was still a bit shy of his second birthday. He won gold at the 2021 World Championships and another gold at the 2023 Pan American Games.\n\nRoscoe Hill (flyweight), Omari Jones (welterweight), and Joshua Edwards (super heavyweight) will also compete in the men’s tournaments. Edwards won gold at the Pan American Games, too, but he’s in a division with a massive and clear favorite in Uzbekistan’s Bakhodir Jalolov, who won gold in Tokyo.\n\nOn the women’s side, Team USA sends Jennifer Lozano (flyweight), Alyssa Mendoza (featherweight), Jajaira Gonzalez (lightweight), and Morelle McCane (welterweight).\n\nTwo Cubans – Arlen Lopez and Julio Cesar La Cruz – will look to join elite company as they each chase a third Olympic gold medal, which has only been done three times in Olympic boxing history. The Cubans didn’t have their best showing at the Pan American Games, but their five-fighter squad is still pretty strong.\n\nThe aforementioned Bakhodir Jalolov of Uzbekistan is back at the Olympics, which does allow those with pro experience to compete. Jalolov is 14-0 (14 KO) as a professional and dominated the field in Tokyo a few years ago, which is what is expected of him again in Paris. He has said this could be his final Olympics, even if boxing maintains its place at Los Angeles 2028 and beyond.\n\nKazakhstan’s Kamshybek Kunkabayev, who won a bronze in Tokyo, may be Jalolov’s top threat, but there is intriguing potential in Australia’s Teremoana Junior and Great Britain’s Delicious Orie, too.\n\nTwo top amateurs looking to repeat as gold medalists on the women’s side are Turkey’s Busenaz Sürmeneli and Ireland’s Kellie Harrington.\n\nHarrington has been compared, for obvious reasons, to countrywoman and living legend Katie Taylor, but she did just suffer her first defeat in three years back in April, dropping a decision to Serbia’s Natalia Shadrina.\n\nSürmeneli was dominant in Tokyo and most expect her to repeat without much trouble. She seems to have no interest in turning pro, and if she continues to fight as well as she has been, expect to see her back at the Olympics in Los Angeles, if boxing is still an Olympic sport.\n\nCheck your inbox for a welcome email.\n\nOops.

        "expanded content": "Adidas has removed Bella Hadid from its social media pages  after issuing an apology for “any upset or distress caused”  by its release of an ad campaign for retro sneakers based on  shoes first released during the 1972 Munich Olympics.\n\nThe company selected Hadid as the face of its SL72 project, which marks the 52nd anniversary of the Munich Olympics with a throwback to Adidas’ popular shoe from the 1970s.\n\n Entertainment & Arts \n\nAngela Simmons apologizes after facing backlash for her accessory choice at the 2024 BET Awards, where she toted a bedazzled green purse shaped like a gun.\n\nIn 1972, the Games were marred by the infamous Munich massacre, which happened after Palestinian militant group Black September orchestrated a terrorist attack targeting Israeli Olympic team members, nine of whom were taken hostage.   By the time it was over, 11 Israelis, a West German  police officer and five of the terrorists died. \n\nThe controversy follows the sportswear company’s decision to hire Hadid, who is Palestinian American and  vocal about her advocacy for Palestinian relief efforts. Hadid, 27, has been posting her support for  the Palestinian cause on social media for years. In 2017, the model  spelled out her thoughts on Instagram. \n\n“Watching the news and seeing the pain of the Palestinian people makes me cry for the many many generations of Palestine. Seeing the sadness of my father, cousins, and Palestinian family that are feeling for our Palestinian ancestors makes this even harder to write,” Hadid said. “The TREATMENT of the Palestinian people is unfair, one-sided and should not be tolerated. I stand with Palestine.”\n\nAdidas faced criticism from Jewish organizations and Israel for aligning the SL72 campaign with a model known for her  pro-Palestinian sentiments. The American Jewish Committee condemned Adidas’ decision, labeling it either a “massive oversight or intentionally inflammatory.”\n\n Entertainment & Arts \n\nIn an Instagram post, model Bella Hadid wrote about suffering from a multitude of health issues throughout her life, including Lyme disease.\n\n“For Adidas to pick a vocal anti-Israel model to recall this dark Olympics is either a massive oversight or intentionally inflammatory. Neither is acceptable. We call on Adidas to address this egregious error,” the AJC said in a post on the social media platform X. \n\nAdidas subsequently issued its apology.\n\n“The adidas Originals SL72 campaign unites a broad range of partners to celebrate our lightweight running shoe, designed more than 50 years ago and worn in sport and culture around the world,” a spokesperson told The Times via email. \n\n“We are conscious that connections have been made to tragic historical events — though these are completely unintentional — and we apologize for any upset or distress caused. As a result we are revising the remainder of the campaign. We believe in sport as a unifying force around the world and will continue our efforts to champion diversity and equality in everything we do.”\n\n Entertainment & Arts \n\nBella Hadid shares a reflection about her sobriety during her dry July, as she approaches nearly 10 months without drinking alcohol. \n\nRepresentatives for Hadid were not  reachable for comment Friday. A pinned post on the model’s Instagram account from 2021 underscores her commitment to raising awareness about Palestinian issues.\n\n“A Palestinian girl on the cover of Vogue. The joy it brings me to say that….I won’t stop talking about the systematic oppression, pain and humility that Palestinians face on a regular basis. With only love in my heart and an open mind to educate myself and learn more every day….

(Getty Images: Tim de Waele)\n\nTadej Pogačar pulled away from Jonas Vingegaard to lead by 5 minutes and 3 seconds with two stages to go.\n\nWith only two stages to go, it looks next to impossible for Vingegaard to pull back his Slovenian rival.\n\nThe Tour de France will conclude on Sunday night (AEST) on French Riviera and not in Paris, due to the Olympics.\n\nAs the finish line approached, Tadej Pogačar looked over his shoulder and saw an empty road.\n\nMoments later, he was a giant step closer to clinching a third Tour de France title by winning another tough mountain stage. Pogacar pulled away from Jonas Vingegaard to be 5 minutes, 3 seconds ahead of his main rival with two days left.\n\n\"Now I have a good lead,\" Pogačar said. \n\n\"I will do the last two days of the Tour on the roads where I have trained my entire professional career.\"\n\nThe Slovenian looks almost certain to reclaim the Tour crown from Vingegaard, the two-time defending champion from Denmark, and in doing so secure the Giro d'Italia and Tour de France double.\n\nBehind a fading Vingegaard sits Tour debutant Remco Evenepoel of Belgium, who is 7:01 adrift in third place.\n\nPogačar attacked with about 9km left on the final climb of 16km to the Isola 2000 ski resort. Vingegaard could not follow as Pogačar chased after the Dane's Jumbo Visma teammate, Matteo Jorgenson. The American rider was alone in front with Richard Carapaz and Simon Yates just behind him.\n\nCarapaz and Yates were caught by Pogačar, leaving just Jorgenson ahead. He was overtaken with 2km left as the UAE Team Emirates leader soared to his fourth stage win this month — holding up four fingers to the fans — and 15th Tour stage victory of his career.\n\n\"As I approached the last two kilometres, I felt a little drained. I still caught Richard Carapaz and Simon Yates and I could catch up with Matteo Jorgenson,\" Pogačar said. \n\n\"When it was time to pass him, I pushed as hard as possible to overtake him with speed. He was very strong today, as were all the guys in the breakaway. Hats off to them.\"\n\nAfter four hours in the saddle, Pogačar raised both hands in the air as he crossed the line. Jorgensen was 21 seconds behind and Yates 40 seconds back in third. Carapaz was 1:11 back in fourth spot.\n\n\"I knew today's last climb very well. With the team, we planned it well and we did exactly as we said,\" Pogačar said. \n\n\"Our race was 100 per cent perfect.\"\n\nEvenepoel placed fifth ahead of a disconsolate Vingegaard, with both riders timed at 1:42 behind Pogačar.\n\nSaturday's 20th and penultimate stage stays in the southern Alps and features three hard category 1 ascents, the last taking the riders up Col de la Couillole.\n\nABC Sport Daily is your daily sports conversation.

Vingegaard could not catch Pogačar and, instead, found himself under pressure from Evenepoel, who just beat him in a sprint to the line.\n\nIt was a day to forget for Vingegaard, and another one to savour for Pogačar.\n\n\"Reaching the score of 15 Tour stage victories is quite formidable,\" he said.\n\nAP\n\nTopic:NRL\n\nTopic:Paralympic Games\n\nTopic:Sport\n\nTopic:Police\n\nTopic:State of Origin\n\nTopic:Health\n\nAnalysis by Patricia Karvelas\n\nTopic:Foreign Aid\n\nTopic:Alternative Energy\n\nTopic:Courts\n\nTopic:Road Cycle Racing\n\nTopic:Road Cycle Racing\n\nTopic:Road Cycle Racing\n\nTopic:Road Cycle Racing\n\nTopic:Road Cycle Racing\n\nTopic:Road Cycle Racing\n\nCycle Sport\n\nFrance\n\nRoad Cycle Racing\n\nSport\n\nTopic:Health\n\nAnalysis by Patricia Karvelas\n\nTopic:Foreign Aid\n\nTopic:Alternative Energy\n\nTopic:Courts\n\nTopic:World War 2\n\nTopic:Children's Health\n\nTopic:Activism and Lobbying\n\nTopic:Indigenous Culture\n\nWe acknowledge Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples as the First Australians and Traditional Custodians of the lands where we live, learn, and work.\n\nThis service may include material from Agence France-Presse (AFP), APTN, Reuters, AAP, CNN and the BBC World Service which is copyright and cannot be reproduced.\n\nAEST = Australian Eastern Standard Time which is 10 hours ahead of GMT (Greenwich Mean Time)"

A report in The Guardian stated that the 19-year-old withdrew from the Japanese Olympic team after it was determined she had violated the team’s code of conduct. Miyata’s withdrawal comes just a week before the Olympics are set to begin in Paris.\n\n“We apologize from the bottom of our hearts for this,” said Tadashi Fujita, president of the Japanese Gymnastics Association. Miyata is the reigning Japanese champion, and at the 2022 World Championships, she took home the bronze medal on the balance beam. Mutsumi Harada, Miyata’s coach, was understandably upset about the situation.\n\n“She was spending her days really burdened with so much pressure. I implore people to understand that,” Harada told the press on Friday. According to The Guardian, he was wiping away tears while giving his statement.\n\nPoor Shoko! It’s not like she was using performance-enhancing drugs. If anything, a hangover probably makes you worse on the beam. I do feel that some blame must be put on Team Japan. You sent a stressed-out 19-year-old perfectionist to Europe — of course she was going to start smoking.\n\nIn happier gymnastics news, Team USA is en route to Paris. The whole squad, including Simone Biles, shared some version of a “Going ✈️Paris 🇫🇷” Instagram story.

It said: “We are conscious that connections have been made to tragic historical events – though these are completely unintentional – and we apologise for any upset or distress caused.\n\n“As a result, we are revising the remainder of the campaign.”\n\nIt did not set out what changes would be made.

The ranking is topped by American swimmer Michael Phelps.\n\nBolt is just one of three non-Americans to make the top 10, the others being Argentina’s Lionel Messi for football and the Swiss tennis great, Roger Federer ranked at six.\n\nOf Bolt, ESPN’s Alyssa Roenigk listed his key accomplishments as: Eight-time Olympic gold medalist, 100m world-record holder, only sprinter to win Olympic 100m and 200m titles at three consecutive Olympics.\n\nLooking back at the 100m semifinal at the 2016 Rio Olympics, Roenigk said: “Their legs are a blur. What’s in focus is Bolt’s expressive mug as he surges ahead in the 100-meter semifinal, his fourth and final Games. In the photo, the now 37-year-old Jamaican is looking back, smiling, almost taunting the three men giving chase. The race is not over — and yet it is. The image was a sensation at the time and has endured as one of the most indelible of Bolt’s career, which saw him set his first world record in the 100 at 21. His 2009 world record in the 100 (9.58 seconds) still stands today.”\n\nRoenigk listed Fraser-Pryce’s key accomplishments as: Eight-time Olympic medalist, three-time Olympic gold medalist, record five 100-meter world titles, oldest sprinter (35 in 2022) to win world title.\n\nSaid Roenigk: “One day after Usain Bolt’s win in the 100 meters at the 2008 Beijing Olympics, Fraser-Pryce became the first woman from the Caribbean to win Olympic gold in the event. Four years later, she defended her title in the 100 (as did Bolt), further cementing Jamaica’s reputation as a sprinting powerhouse. Only 5 feet tall and typically sporting rainbow locks, the “Pocket Rocket” has medaled in track and field’s fastest race in the past four Games. In Paris, her fifth and final Olympics, Fraser-Pryce will line up once more with the goal of reclaiming her title as the fastest woman alive.”\n\nESPN’s Top 10:\n1-Michael Phelps – Swimming\n2-Serena Williams – Tennis\n3-Lionel Messi – Soccer\n4-Lebron James – Basketball\n5-Tom Brady  – American Football\n6-Roger Federer – Tennis\n7-Simone Biles – Gymnastics\n8-Tiger Woods – Golf\n9-Usain Bolt – Track and Field\n10-Kobe Bryant – Basketball\n\nESPN acknowledged that ranking the top 100 most accomplished athletes since 2000 “wasn’t quite so easy after all — but it sure was fun” . It reminded that “25 years ago, the ESPN SportsCentury project ranked the top 100 North American athletes of the 20th century. Michael Jordan came in first, followed by Babe Ruth, Muhammad Ali, Jim Brown and Wayne Gretzky. We also ranked a horse: Secretariat came in at No. 35”.\n\nESPN said that “with so many transcendent athletes over the past 25 years, we thought it was time to do another ranking.” \n\nThere were no horses this time around but the choices were extended beyond North America. \n\nAdditionally, ESPN editions from around the globe contributed to the nominations and voting process, as well as the individual sport list rankings.\n\nOf note is that voters were instructed to consider only an athlete’s performance since 2000. In the end, ESPN said it received more than 70,000 votes from its contributors to create the top 100.\n\nOf the top 100 athletes, 56 are American, five are from Spain, four are Canadians, four are from the Dominican Republic, three each are from France and Japan and two are Jamaicans.\n\nWith the United States being a basketball-obsessed nation, it is not surprising that 24 of the top 100 are basketballers. Baseball has 17 entries, soccer 15, American football 12, tennis six, golf four, boxing four, track and field three.\n\nTags: \n\nHOUSE RULES"

Thinaah and mixed doubles act Chen Tang Jie-Toh Ee Wei – have also given the thumbs-up for the colourful Sarawakian’s approach.\n\nFrom taking Aaron-Wooi Yik for a three-day mental training outdoor event in Penang last month to constantly lifting up the spirits of Tang Jie-Ee Wei, who will be making their debut at the Games, the veteran trainer seems to be doing quite a bit.\n\nTang Jie, whose performance with Ee Wei had been inconsistent this year, said Fred has been a calming factor as they tried to bounce back from their recent struggles due to the physically and mentally exhausting Olympic qualifying period where they pipped veterans Goh Soon Huat-Shevon Lai Jemie to the sole Malaysian spot in the mixed doubles.\n\n“Personally, I feel a mental trainer is necessary for a player because we always go through ups and downs in our career. Not just in tournaments but also during training sessions and we need someone to discuss our struggles,” said Tang Jie.\n\n“Fred has always supported our growth on and of the court. He is also naturally a positive person and he has spread that mindset to us.”\n\nFred, who often combines physical activities and mental sessions to motivate the players, has continued his efforts during Malaysia’s 10-day training camp in Aire Sur La Lys in northern France.\n\nThe often reserved Wooi Yik has been more outspoken and looks confident while the smiles are back on the faces of all the players heading the Olympics and the camp seems to be providing the needed impact before they depart to Paris.\n\nFred has done his early work of calming the nerves of the three pairs and his real task will start during the competition at the Adidas Arena in Port de la Chapelle from Juny 27-Aug 5 where they will start battling for medals.\n\nHe may have to revisit the days in Beijing and find new ways to help the current batch emulate what Chong Wei had done 16 years ago.\n\nThank you for your report!\n\nCopyright © 1995-\n            \n\n Star Media Group Berhad [197101000523 (10894-D)]\n\nBest viewed on Chrome browsers.\n\n\n\nWe would love to keep you posted on the latest promotion.

If he can do some homework, this could be his Olympics,” said Rashid.\n\n“Analysis will provide us with the finer details on our opponents as we need to be assured when we play them. Our mind will be clear with our game plan and we will be more prepared to catch our rivals off guard.\n\n“Ginting has a better record but video analysis can always give that additional info for Zii Jia to overcome the Indonesian player and also Antonsen who has a better record.\n\n“Once he gets into the semi-finals, Zii Jia will be totally motivated and it will be easier to focus on his objective of going for gold.\n\n“In 1996, I wasn’t given much of a chance against Joko as I had not beaten him in four years prior to the Olympics but a bit of analysis on Joko made me battle with a clear mind.\n\n“I could have given up after losing to Dong Jiong in the semi-finals but I fought back. I had lost seven times in a row to Hariyanto before beating him for the bronze.\n\n“Zii Jia should be in peak condition when it comes to on-court and physical preparation but the sufficient time on video analysis and tactics during these final days will serve him better.”\n\nZii Jia should have no problems getting past the group stage where he is with Pablo Abian of Spain and Viren Nettasinghe of Sri Lanka.\n\nGinting is in Group H with Toma Popov of France and American Howard Shu while Antonsen is in Group G with Collins Filimon of Romania and Ade Resky of Azerbaijan.\n\nRashid also feels that Zii Jia has been hitting form nicely after having won the Thailand and Australian Opens and finishing runners-up in the Malaysian Masters this year.\n\nZii Jia has a 1-5 head-to-head record against Ginting while Antonsen also has a better record (5-3) against the Malaysian.\n\nHowever, Rashid believes match analysis should give Zii Jia a headstart with his rivals and put him in a positive frame of mind in Paris.\n\nThank you for your report!\n\nCopyright © 1995-\n            \n\n Star Media Group Berhad [197101000523 (10894-D)]\n\nBest viewed on Chrome browsers.\n\n\n\nWe would love to keep you posted on the latest promotion.

(AP Photo/Frank Franklin II, File)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBoxing is already on the Olympic ropes after an epic fight between its banished governing body and the IOC. Although the sport has been a staple of Olympic programs for over a century, it could be dropped before the Los Angeles Games if big changes in governance don’t happen in the next year.\n\nThe fights are still on in Paris this month, but this Olympic tournament will look like nothing fans have seen in decades — for better in some ways, and probably for worse in others.\n\nTwelve years after women’s boxing made its Olympic debut with just 36 fighters in three weight classes in London, the sport likely has achieved gender parity, reaching the overall Olympic movement’s goal. Give or take a few last-minute additions or dropouts, half of the 248 boxers in Paris will be women fighting in six weight classes.\n\nBut this milestone was reached by sharply cutting the number of male boxers in an overall field that will be the smallest for Olympic boxing since 1956. While there will be 23 more women fighting in Paris than in Tokyo three years ago, there will also be a whopping 63 fewer men, and they’re fighting in only seven weight classes — the fewest since 1908.\n\nIn fact, Paris will have dozens fewer boxers than in every other Games in the 21st century. The 248 fighters in Paris are a shadow of the Olympic-record 432 who participated in Seoul in 1988, and it’s even down sharply from the 289 boxers who participated in Tokyo.\n\nUSA Boxing head coach Billy Walsh has been an ardent proponent of the women’s sport ever since he coached Katie Taylor of his native Ireland to a gold medal in London, and he says the addition of three women’s weight classes in Paris is “fantastic.”\n\n\n\n\nWalsh still recognizes the drawbacks to the sport’s growth when it comes up against the IOC’s typically firm cap on total Olympic participants. It’s rare to add more athletes to a traditional Olympic sport, particularly while the IOC is adding trendy new sports to each Games.\n\n“It is sad in a sense for the men,” said Walsh, who competed for Ireland in the Seoul Olympics in 1988. “Because when I boxed, they had 12 (men’s) weight divisions. They went down to 10, and then down to eight, and now we’re down to seven.”\n\nIn Rio de Janeiro eight years ago, 250 men had the career-defining honor of being Olympic boxers. That number has been halved just eight years later, with 124 men competing at three fewer weights than in Rio.\n\nMen’s boxing in Paris will have its fewest weight classes since 1908 in London, where the second boxing tournament in the modern Olympics was contested at just five weights. Three years earlier in Tokyo, men’s boxing already dropped to eight weight classes for the first time since 1948.\n\nThat means there is no longer an Olympic weight class between 71 kilograms (156 pounds) and 80 kilograms (176 pounds). Professional middleweights fight at 160 pounds, and super middleweights weigh in at 168 pounds, but any fighter who couldn’t go down or up to the Olympic limits was out of luck.\n\nThat’s a concern to Walsh and many others around the sport. The elimination of weight classes encourages fighters to stretch the limits of their bodies to see if they can fit into a less-than-ideal weight class for qualification — and that can lead to mismatches up and down the scales.\n\n“When we’ve narrowed down the numbers, it’s also put a big gap in the weight divisions,” Walsh said. “There’s so much gap now. There’s a reason why there are (weight classes). It’s because of the power of the punch. These guys are hurting you. There’s damage you can do. If some guy is barely making the welterweight division, he’s got 10 kilos he has to put on, and the other guy is coming down from four or five kilos above that, it’s a lot of power in the punch. It’s a combat sport, and people do get hurt, do get injured. I worry about that.”\n\nFewer overall fighters means smaller teams for many nations — and fewer chances to win gold, even for the traditional powers of the sport.\n\nThe U.S., which has won the most total medals and gold medals in Olympic history, qualified eight fighters for Paris under a challenging new qualification system administered by the IOC task force overseeing the tournament. The American team will have fewer fighters than Australia — which had an extraordinarily easy path to Paris under the new system — Brazil, Ireland or modern amateur boxing powers Uzbekistan and Kazakhstan.\n\nCuba, which ranks right behind the U.S. in Olympic achievements, improbably will have only five fighters in Paris after two men failed to clinch a spot during the final qualifying tournament. Cuba also has no women on its team for the fourth straight Olympics, even though the nation belatedly lifted its internal ban on the women’s sport in late 2022.\n\nYet the small Cuban delegation includes two-time gold medalists Arlen López and Julio César La Cruz. They’ll both try to join Hungary’s László Papp and fellow Cubans Teofilo Stevenson and Félix Savón as the only three-time Olympic boxing champions.\n\nThe smaller field will lead to a different kind of competition in Paris: Fewer bouts with higher stakes. That could be exciting, particularly when fresher fighters move into the medal rounds, which will be held at the famed Roland Garros tennis complex.\n\nMany fighters only need to win two bouts to clinch an Olympic medal, including every man fighting at heavyweight and super heavyweight. Both of those divisions have only 16 competitors, and no weight class in Paris has more than 22 fighters.\n\nThe tournament won’t even run for the entire Olympiad: For the first time in decades, boxing competition will conclude one day before the closing ceremony.\n\n“It’s going to be different, that’s for sure,” Walsh said. “But it will be exciting.”\n\n___\n\nAP Summer Olympics: https://apnews.com/hub/2024-paris-olympic-games\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCopyright 2025 The Associated Press.

To have the chance to compete well against a great player like Cameron, these are great feelings. I played for moments of good tennis. For moments I needed to play more aggressive.\n\nOur community members are treated to special offers, promotions, and adverts from us and our partners. You can check out at any time.

Matches and victories like today help to be in rhythm the whole match and put the pressure on the opponent during the whole match. That’s something I need to improve today. Because I haven’t played enough.”\n\nNadal was also informed that former Chelsea and Manchester United midfielder Juan Mata was in the crowd watching on. The pair were able to bond in celebration of Spain's Euro 2024 final victory over England on Sunday, insisting that they are on the same wavelength.\n\n“Well I think it’s great to have Juan here on the stands,\" Nadal added. \"Unexpected for me to see him in Bastad. Sports people talk the same language.”\n\n\n\nNadal set up a quarter-final with Argentinian star Mariano Navone, who overcame Sumit Nagal in the previous round, as he continues to build up his fitness in an attempt to win a third Olympic gold of his career.\n\nThe 38-year-old knows that after skipping the grass-court season and Wimbledon in order to avoid the physical stress that comes with changing surfaces, he is without match practice and even with 22 Grand Slam titles in the bank, is prepared to put the work in to be in the best possible position to succeed in Paris.\n\nWe use your sign-up to provide content in ways you've consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

(TYR via AP)\n\n\n\nThe international governing body, now known as World Aquatics, decided the polyurethane suits — many of them covering nearly the entire body — were making a mockery of the sport. So the organization hastily imposed strict new rules requiring textile fabrics and limiting the amount of body coverage from the hip to just above the knees for men, while women’s racing attire cannot extend past the shoulder or cover the neck.\n\nFor coaches such as Bob Bowman, who worked with Phelps over his entire career and was on hand in Rome for a speed show that bordered on a farce, the rules are just fine the way they are.\n\n“Everybody is on a level playing field,” he said. “We’re still breaking world records in these suits. The sport is moving forward.”\n\n\n\n\nBut major swimsuit designers such as Speedo, TYR and arena are pushing for the guidelines to be liberalized.\n\nThey pump millions of dollars into the sport, and would love nothing more than to be allowed to come up with revolutionary new designs that lead to vastly improved performances. But as things stand now, their hands are largely tied. Faster times come in tiny increments.\n\nThe suits remain an important element for any swimmer’s performance, but the impact is nothing like it was during the rubber era.\n\n“I think a lot of our sport is just mental,” U.S. Olympian Hunter Armstrong said. “It’s just about feeling good in the water.”\n\nThe manufacturers are desperate to do more.\n\n“When the pushback came after those world championships in Rome, (World Aquatics) freaked out and they said we need rules quickly, we need to do something,” said Greg Steyger, the head of innovation and design at Italian-based arena. “Unfortunately, that was in such a hurry that those rules are not the right rules for sure. But they’ve stuck to them, they’ve defended them, they’ve done everything to keep them.”\n\nRachel Ripley, the director of merchandising at TYR, said her company is constantly lobbying for an easing of the restrictions.\n\n“It’s been pretty status quo for 15 years,” she said. “There hasn’t really been much push or shake-up. It’s something that I think we constantly talk about, but it requires more than just the manufacturers to make that change happen.”\n\nEven with rules as they are, the swimsuit manufacturers say they are still able to come up with innovative creations that can make a crucial difference in a sport where races are often decided by mere hundredths of a second.\n\nFor Speedo, the new Fastskin LZR Intent and LZR Valor suits were developed through a partnership with Lamoral, a company better known for protective coatings that are used to extend the life of satellites in outer space.\n\nThen there’s TYR’s Venzo suit, which is made with a frictionless yarn that evolved from military uses, most notably in socks worn by infantry soldiers who do a lot of marching.\n\nNot to be outdone, arena has come up with the POWERSKIN Primo that it bills as the “world’s first tensoelastic suit,” made of a trademarked fabric known as Hyperforce that supposedly provides the maximum amount of body compression — a key element in buoyancy — but far more flexibility than previous designs.\n\n“You’re talking about maybe a 1% difference in a race,” said Olympic gold medalist Ryan Murphy, America’s top men’s backstroke swimmer and a longtime Speedo-endorsed athlete. “Any little thing we can get to improve times, improve body position in the water, assist your technique, you’re really looking for that.”\n\nThis undated handout provided by arena shows Gretchen, left, and Alex Walsh wearing arena’s powerskin primo swimsuit. (Jack Spitzer/Arena via AP)\n\n\n\nMost swimmers seem content with the state of affairs, though everyone is looking for ways to go a bit faster to gain that little extra edge.\n\n“The innovation should be in other areas, like maybe the starting blocks,” Italian swimmer Nicolò Martinenghi said.\n\nSarah Sjostrom of Sweden certainly had no complaints about the polyurethane suits allowed back in 2009, which she wore while winning the 100-meter butterfly in a world-record time a few weeks before her 16th birthday.\n\nBut she also remembers the down side.\n\n“The biggest stress for me back then and as well as other swimmers was like getting the suit on,” Sjostrom said. “It’s a lot easier nowadays to put on the suit, but they still give a good compression, which is really important to have a good feeling in the water.”\n\nShe said the current guidelines also keep prices more affordable for a wider range of swimmers, though a high-tech female suit can still go for around $650.\n\n“It’s good because the young kids can get the same kind of suit that I race in,” Sjostrom said. “It’s within reach for everyone.”\n\nNo matter the rules, it’s not a stretch to say an Olympic year is just as important to the manufacturers as it is to their swimmers. \n\nThis undated handout provided by TYR shows American swimmer Bobby Finke wearing TYR’s Venzo swimsuit. (TYR via AP)\n\n\n\nEvery time someone wearing their brand touches the wall first in Paris, it will help to move suits at the grassroots level. Certainly, there is no better endorsement of a product than a gold medal.\n\nThere’s even some good-natured trash-talking among the brands.\n\n“I can fairly confidently say that we have been innovating over the years far in advance of Speedo and TYR,” Steyger said. “Speedo has always been extremely good at marketing,” he added with a smile.\n\nWhile Speedo has long dominated the swimsuit wars, especially in the lucrative American market, the other companies are looking to carve out their own niche.\n\n“The Olympics gets everyone involved,” said Mark Pinger, a former German Olympic medalist who now serves as U.S. general manager at arena. “For us, it’s a huge opportunity to get people that might not know who we are — especially in the U.S. — to take note of the brand.”\n\nIt will be interesting to see where things go in swimsuit design after the Paris Olympics.\n\nWhile major changes seem unlikely, the companies will keep pushing for greater leeway. One thought is to allow men’s suits to provide the same skin coverage as the women’s style — and, therefore, a more prominent spot for a company’s logo across the chest rather than on the thigh.\n\n“I think they can do little more,” Bowman said. “If they wanted more coverage with the same fabric, OK, that could be a thing.”\n\nBut, the coach quickly added, “we can’t back into rubber suits like before.”\n\n___\n\nAP Sports Writer Andrew Dampf in Rome contributed to this report.\n\n___\n\nAP Summer Olympics: https://apnews.com/hub/2024-paris-olympic-games\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCopyright 2025 The Associated Press.

        "expanded content": "SINGAPORE – Arguably, no one is going to be watching the Paris Olympics for the fashion. \n\nThere is, after all, plenty to admire among the thousands of youthful athletes striving to be “faster, higher, stronger” in the various competitions. \n\nBut with no actual sport taking place during the Parade of Nations segment of the opening ceremony on July 26, fashion commentary will become a spectator sport for the millions of people tuning in. \n\nContingents from more than 200 countries will not be marching into a stadium, but will float down the French capital’s iconic River Seine instead. All will be donning threads that show off the best of their home countries, many of which were created by top designers. \n\nThe Straits Times highlights eight winners and losers to look out for during the spectacle, which will be streamed live on Singtel TV, Cast.SG and mewatch on July 27 at 1.30am. \n\nIf the matter of national uniforms is a best-dressed competition judged by the online masses, Mongolia can probably take a victory lap. \n\nSocial media users are full of praise for the garments, which are an updated take on the traditional Mongolian robe known as the deel and have gone viral. \n\nRaves on X range from “is this the nicest Olympic uniform ever made” to “these are warrior fits, and they go hard”. On TikTok, a user effused: “It is truly a blend of beauty and (tradition).”\n\nThe richly detailed uniforms are designed by Mongolian couture brand Michel & Amazonka, helmed by the sister trio of Michel, Amazonka and Munkhjargal Choigaalaa. Each set took an average of 20 hours to produce, according to the Mongolian National Olympic Committee. \n\nLook closely, and you will see various motifs embroidered on the tunics, collars and cuffs – such as the Olympic torch and rings, along with traditional Mongolian cloud and mountain patterns. \n\nTeam Canada will keep cool in more ways than one while dressed in their maple-red athleisure outfits made by popular Canadian activewear label Lululemon.\n\nThe jacquard bomber jackets and shorts are made of sweat-wicking fabrics, and emblazoned with a print design that includes motifs of art, nature and architecture found throughout Canada, such as beavers and moose. \n\nAs one netizen declared: “Team Canada would win gold if it was a fashion contest.”\n\nYou have to love an outfit that works for multiple occasions, and no doubt many of the athletes will keep these functional and stylish outfits long after the Games are over.\n\nHaiti may be undergoing political and social upheaval, but its dozen or so Olympic athletes will proudly represent their country in uniforms designed by Haitian-Italian designer Stella Jean.\n\n“These athletes will stand and compete for a nation that asks the world not to forget that it has changed history,” she wrote on Instagram.\n\nJean incorporated the work of Haitian artist Philippe Dodard into the attire, weaving his painting titled Passage into her design for the trousers and skirts.\n\nThe women’s skirt is paired with a light blue chambray shirt and a sleeveless blazer made from recycled fabric, while the men’s trousers are paired with a striped shirt, scarf and jacket inspired by the Guayabera shirt favoured by Haitian men.\n\n“You have managed to capture our souls,” said an Instagram user, thanking Jean for her work. \n\nMeanwhile, a TikTok user wondered: “Are they going to a fashion show or what? My gosh, the uniform is beautiful.”\n\nAt first glance, the Czech contingent’s uniforms – designed by Czech sportswear label Alpine Pro – are startling. Arguably, the trench coat resembles a stained smock you would put on to protect your clothes while painting walls.\n\nBut the fit is flattering, and no one can say the outfits are boring or forgettable. \n\nThe inner uniform consists of a more conventional sports T-shirt and a pair of casual trousers. Notably, the triangular pattern on the back of the shirt calls to mind the triangle on the Czech flag, which is red, blue and white. \n\nMany Czech netizens praised the originality of the designs, with one person on Instagram writing: “Finally, athletes will not look like they bought their clothes on sale from Alpine Pro. The oversized fit will fit various body types, from slim to broad-shouldered.”\n\nThere were also a few users who admitted to not “getting” the designs. \n\nBut as the 56-year-old head of the Czech Olympic Committee and former rowing champion Jiri Kejval pointed out: “My generation may be surprised, but it will be worn mainly by young people who appreciate the designs.\n\n“If the athletes feel comfortable in the clothes, they will have the confidence needed for their sporting performance.”\n\nFrench brand Berluti, known for making belts and menswear, designed the French contingent’s opening ceremony uniform for the Olympics and Paralympics Games taking place in its homeland. \n\nThe men’s uniform is a sleek, well-tailored take on the classic suit, with thoughtful details such as red-and-blue ombre lapels that together with the white shirt, represent the French flag. \n\nBut they apparently ran out of jacket sleeves for the women. Unfortunately, the sleeveless look contrasts jarringly with the stiff material and formal cutting of the jacket. \n\nPairing the sleeveless jacket with a skirt makes it even more dowdy. It is more reminiscent of line judges from the Wimbledon tennis tournament circa a decade ago than of top athletes in 2024. \n\nSome TikTok users even feel the uniforms resemble cabin crew attire, with one saying that “they look like flight attendants”.\n\nOn the bright side, given that France has been assaulted by deadly heat over the summer, at least the women of the French Olympic contingent will be able to keep a little more cool than their male counterparts. \n\nThe Olympic Council of Malaysia had hoped that the gold-themed opening ceremony uniforms would be as fierce as the country’s national animal, the Malayan tiger known for its sharp and strong claws.\n\nUnfortunately, the only “shredding” that followed after the unveiling in late June was that by Malaysia’s social media community, who came out in force to condemn the original iteration. \n\n“We dress them in these and expect gold medals in return?” mocked one commenter on Instagram.\n\n“It’s not too late to delete (this announcement) before other news outlets pick this up,” urged another user. \n\nThe ribbing was savage enough that the Olympic Council went back to the drawing board with official manufacturer Yonex Sunrise.\n\nThe updated iteration uses a thicker fabric that does not have the cheap look that plagued the original. Meanwhile, the orange collar, cuffs and ombre slash design are subtle but impactful callbacks to the claws of the powerful and dangerous tiger.  \n\nThe revised uniforms seem to have escaped the ire of Malaysian netizens.  \n\nYou cannot go wrong with a reputable American fashion house like Ralph Lauren designing your Olympics kit, right? After all, it is a celebrity favourite for glamorous red-carpet events and award shows, and during sophisticated sporting events such as the annual Wimbledon tennis tournament in London.  \n\nBut that is precisely the problem, as Team USA’s uniforms make them look like posh prep school students who got lost on the way to a horse ranch. \n\nBetween the navy blue blazer with red and white piping, the pin-striped Oxford shirt, the tie and the light-washed denim jeans, there is too much happening – and none of it is good. The result is a look reminiscent of retro Uncle Sam war propaganda posters – all they are missing are top hats.\n\nThere is a marginal improvement in the women’s outfits, which seems to do away with the neck ties and the top buttons on the shirts. But there is no coming back from those jeans.\n\nAs a user commented on X: “It’s giving yeehaw mixed with flight attendant.”\n\nTeam Singapore has mostly stuck to a core uniform of a red jacket and light-coloured trousers for the last few Olympics Games, including Tokyo 2020.\n\nThere have been minor variations via the use of accessories such as scarves, though in 2000, there was a small change-up with female athletes wearing all-beige outfits.\n\nAs Mr Chris Chan, secretary-general of the Singapore National Olympic Council (SNOC), told ST in 2012: “Prior to 1973, our national sportsmen wore an all-beige ensemble for formal dress. But the late Minister for Law and National Development, Mr E.W. Barker, suggested a red and beige uniform to represent the national colours. (Since then), Team Singapore wears the same formal attire at all major sporting events, including the Asian and Commonwealth Games.”\n\nHe added: “What works for any formal occasion is always a jacket and pants... we don’t need to be the most fashionable.”\n\nAs seen in a video shared by national swimmer Quah Jing Wen on TikTok on July 12, Singapore’s athletes will once more don the red blazer, white button-up shirt and beige trousers.\n\nBut a couple of commenters on her video did wonder if it was time for an update, with one writing: “I would like the Singapore uniform to evolve... It is too stale.”  \n\nAnother simply blurted “Junior College uniform”, perhaps because of the uncanny resemblance to the formal attire worn by National Junior College students.\n\nA spokesman for SNOC says that national athletes will be accessorising with special edition Paris 2024 ties and scarves, designed by local dressmaker Esther Tay and her design studio Esta. Ms Tay and her team also tailored the opening ceremony uniforms for Paris 2024.\n\nJoin ST's Telegram channel and get the latest breaking news delivered to you.\n\n\n\nTerms and conditions apply\n\nFrequently asked questions\n\nMDDI (P) 048/10/2024.

As much as I wish this wasn’t true, sadly it is time to call it a day to my swimming career, a chapter that consumed almost 25 years of my life,” Larkin wrote on Instagram.\n\n“It truly is hard to comprehend all the incredible memories, friendships and stories this sport has provided. Looking back as a kid dreaming of swimming for Australia, I am lucky to say I was able to live out my childhood dream.”\n\nLarkin went on to thank everyone and wish the Aussies good luck in Paris.\n\n“To those of you who I ever raced, shared a lane or was able to call a team mate, coach or staff, THANK YOU for the best 25 years I could have ever dreamt of. To my parents and family THANK YOU for allowing me to dream and being my biggest supporters during the sports most challenging times. To anyone who has ever supported the Dolphins THANK YOU,” he continued.\n\n“To those of you who dream of representing AUS one day… I envy you. I would give it all to be a young kid again just knowing the wild adventures and friendships that are ahead of you. Walking out to your name being announced wearing the green and gold, single handedly makes every sacrifice worthwhile.\n\n“To those of you in Paris living out their dreams best of luck and absolutely rip in, myself and the rest of this country is behind you.

We have to accept this. I want to thank Pan-gon because, in the two-and-a-half years he was with us, the national team’s ranking improved and Malaysia qualified on merit for the Asian Cup Finals after 42 years. His huge contribution will never be forgotten.\n\n“So, even though Harimau Malaya will be without Pan-gon, I hope all Malaysians will give their undivided support to Pau Marti Vicente, who will be at the helm starting with the 2024 Merdeka Football Tournament in September,” said Hamidin in a posting on FAM’s Facebook page.\n\nHamidin met up with Vicente to discuss Harimau Malaya’s direction and plans in Mallorca, Spain yesterday.\n\nHamidin is the Malaysian chef de mission for the 2024 Paris Olympics and is in Spain to monitor the national track cycling team who are going through training camp. Vicente is on holiday in Spain as well.\n\nAt the press conference, Pan-gon was also asked to clarify what he meant when he mentioned that it was dangerous to explain the reason behind his resignation as the Harimau Malaya head coach.\n\nThe Regent of Johor Tunku Ismail Sultan Ibrahim wrote on his official X account that the South Korean should be specific about what he said in the press conference.\n\n“What’s so difficult? Let the lot of them ask him what he meant by saying it is ‘dangerous’. The fans, politicians and media. Ask him what he meant by ‘dangerous’.\n\n“Be more specific. Scared to be shot? Scared to be kidnapped? Of being kicked? Be direct!” said Tunku Ismail.\n\nThe crown prince was responding to a posting from social media user @RimauXI, who posted a video clip taken from Pan-gon’s press conference.\n\nIn the video, Pan-gon was responding to a question about what changed since his previous press conference when he expressed his desire to continue to improve the national team.\n\nPan-gon responded by saying: “Same answer. I speak to Datuk president ( FAM president Datuk Hamidin Mohd Amin) every single day. That I cannot talk to you ... here ... very danger(ous). He knows all the details. So that thing ... I must honour each other.”\n\nBut Pan-gon has since come out to clarify what he meant in a meeting with Tunku Ismail later in the evening.\n\nPan-gon had explained his choice of words were not accurate because of his poor command of English.\n\nHis real meaning is about matters related to tactics and team development that may be used by the opponent as an advantage if it is revealed to the public.\n\n“I have never felt unsafe in Malaysia and it may be because of my poor command of English that this misunderstanding occurred,” he explained.\n\nThank you for your report!\n\nCopyright © 1995-\n            \n\n Star Media Group Berhad [197101000523 (10894-D)]\n\nBest viewed on Chrome browsers.\n\n\n\nWe would love to keep you posted on the latest promotion.

PA\n\n\n    PA\n\n\nThe swim fulfils a promise Hidalgo made months ago to show the river is clean enough to host open-swimming competitions during the 2024 Games.\n\nShe had originally planned to swim last month, but had to delay because water tests showed that E.Coli bacteria – a key indicator of faecal matter – were sometimes up to 10 times higher than authorised limits.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\nOn the initial date, the hashtag “jechiedanslaSeine” (“I’m pooping in the Seine”) trended on social media as some threatened to protest the Olympics by defecating upstream.\n\nSince 2015, organisers have invested heavily – €1.3 billion – to prepare the Seine for the Olympics and to ensure Parisians have a cleaner river in the years after the Games.\n\n\n            There had been some concerns over water quality in the river.            \n\n\nThe plan included constructing a giant underground water storage basin in central Paris, renovating sewer infrastructure, and upgrading wastewater treatment plants.\n\nDespite being a recurring promise among politicians, swimming in the Seine has been banned for over a century.\n\nJacques Chirac, the former French president, made a similar pledge in 1988 when he was Paris mayor, but it was never realised.\n\nHowever, Hidalgo plans to create three public bathing areas in the Seine for the city’s residents next year – a century after swimming was banned – while fish and other organisms are also returning to the waterway in greater numbers.\n\nHidalgo follows in the footsteps of French Sports Minister Amelie Oudea-Castera, who swam in the Seine on Saturday wearing a full-body suit.\n\n\n            Locals in the Seine River after the mayor of Paris swam in the river to demonstrate that it is clean enough to host the outdoor swimming events.

LeBron ended the night with 11 points and two assists and Davis had seven points six rebounds and six blocks in the win.\n\nTeam USA will play South Sudan next on Saturday at 12 p.m. PT on FS1.\n\nTeam USA’s starting lineup included Steph Curry, Jrue Holiday, Jayson Tatum, Joel Embiid, and LeBron James. \n\nCurry was activated and aggressive early, scoring nine points, but he was the only one who started strong for Team USA as they trailed early in the first. \n\nMidway through the first quarter, Anthony Davis came into the game with Team USA’s second unit and got going immediately, defending Nikola Jokić and scoring a handful of points to even the score at 28 after one. \n\nIn the second quarter, the backup combo of Davis and Bam Adebayo helped lead the charge for Team USA. Davis made big blocks and Adebayo scored inside and from 3-point range. LeBron also got going offensively, attacking the paint and muscling his way to the rim. \n\nLeBronAnd One pic.twitter.com/jgvSWIlmXq\n\nSerbia had no answer for Team USA and the boys in blue held a comfortable 59-49 lead at the break. \n\nThe third quarter was quiet for LeBron, but Davis remained on the floor protecting the rim as Adebayo and Anthony Edwards dominated offensively. Serbia’s offense completely tanked, managing just nine points in the third. \n\nEntering the final frame, Team USA led by 25 points, and the game was essentially done. \n\nDavis continued to be a monster defensively as he rejected a couple more shots, which the crowd responded to with thunderous applause. With the lead remaining unchanged, Davis was subbed out and done for the night with a little over seven minutes left. \n\nFunnily enough, Kerr put LeBron in for garbage time so he could get some more minutes. \n\nThis might be the first time in his career that LeBron played during such an insignificant point in a game. However, he made the most of it and converted on a lob dunk that got the crowd back into it. \n\nLBJ soars in for the oop!    #USABMNT Showcase vs. Serbia on FS1 pic.twitter.com/QB7MBnvJco\n\nA few possessions later, Curry had another deep 3-pointer, followed by a Lebron and one play and Team USA never let up. They maintained their advantage and cruised to victory.  \n\nTeam USA has continued to dominate, but Joel Embiid has been bad. \n\nWith Davis and Adebayo playing so well, Team USA head coach Steve Kerr has to consider either backup big as a starting option.\n\nEvery game has followed the same script, with Team USA struggling early and getting hot after Bam and AD were on the floor. You can’t risk the gold medal in Paris by not starting your best five and so far, the one thing we know is that Embiid hasn’t been playing well enough to earn that starting gig. \n\nYou can follow Edwin on Twitter at @ECreates88.\n\nCheck your inbox for a welcome email.\n\nOops.

The sport debuted at the 1984 Los Angeles Olympics as synchronized swimming.\n\nHowever, the 96 athletes picked by 18 different nations for the Olympics were all women.\n\n“World Aquatics is very disappointed that no male artistic swimmers have been selected for Paris 2024,” the governing body said. “This should have been a landmark moment for the sport.”\n\nThe rules change by World Aquatics in December 2022 allowed up to two men to be selected in an eight-athlete squad for the Olympic open team event. The only other medal event in Paris is women’s duet.\n\nMinisini specializes in the mixed duet event which is not yet on the Olympic program, and missed selection to the team event.\n\nMay was on the U.S. team that won silver and bronze medals in team acrobatic routine at the past two world championships. At age 45, he did not make the Olympic team last month.\n\n“All of us in the artistic swimming community need to work even harder to progress opportunities for male athletes in the sport,” said World Aquatics, which hopes to add a mixed duet event for the 2028 Los Angeles Olympics.\n\n___\n\nAP Summer Olympics: https://apnews.com/hub/2024-paris-olympic-games\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCopyright 2025 The Associated Press.

Three warnings over a year can lead to a case with Anti-Doping Denmark regarding a violation and a possible quarantine.\n\nChristiansen, 30, said in a statement released by Badminton Denmark that he was devastated by his lack of care leading to this result, adding he did not want to be a distraction. Jens Meibom, the organization’s head of sport, said he was convinced it was simply a mistake and there was no evidence to suggest deliberate misconduct on Christiansen’s part.\n\nThe BWF said Christiansen and Boje would not be replaced because there is no provision in qualifying regulations to elevate anyone once groups had been decided. Group C will go on with three teams.\n\nChristiansen and Boje competed in the pandemic-delayed Tokyo Olympics in 2021, finishing third in their group.

Hopefully this gives it the platform to start growing in our country.\n\n\"It is an incredible sport to watch, it’s gruesome to play but it’s so incredible to watch.\n\n\"The Irish fans would love it because it’s an outdoor party all day and you have an incredible sport to watch. It’s like a festival vibe.\n\n\"It’s so intense and it’s all those X factor moments from 15s put on to the rugby field, it’s short and sharp.\"\n\nFlood represented the Dublin minor football team and has also played 15s for Ireland.\n\nA win on the World Series in Perth last January has given the team belief that a podium finish is possible, however, they are reluctant to look too far ahead.\n\nCurrently training in Tours, France, the same base where Andy Farrell’s Ireland side prepared for the World Cup, the team will face USA on Thursday in a friendly game.\n\nWith just 11 days until they begin their campaign, the thrill of representing her country at the Olympics is clearly evident in Flood’s demeanour.\n\n\"It’s pretty exciting to have that opportunity,\" the Railway Union player continued.\n\n\"Just watching the Olympics, seeing all the athletes and how it can change a nation, a game can bring a nation together, sport is so special in that way.\n\n\"There are enough bad things going on in the world, it’s nice to have something to look forward to.\n\n\"When I was growing up watching the Olympics, Ireland were either boxers or long-distance runners. That’s what we saw.\n\n\"I love GAA, it’s your roots, it gives you your values in sport and in life when you are growing up and we are extremely lucky to have that.\n\n\"With sports where you can represent your country, it just hits home differently and I think we are so lucky to have that opportunity to play and represent your country, and maybe inspire a handful of girls to play Sevens.\"\n\nFlood is one of 12 players on Allan Temple-Jones' panel for the event with Meath footballer Vikki Wall one of the hopefuls that missed out on selection.\n\nThe double All-Ireland winner was a high-profile addition to the set-up and joined with the specific goal of making the Games.\n\nWall subsequently lined out for the Royals in their All-Ireland quarter-final defeat to Kerry earlier this month and Flood is hopeful she will stick around for the next Olympic cycle.\n\n\"Vikki added massive value to the programme, on and off the field,\" said Flood, who last December became the third Irish woman to reach 50 Sevens caps.\n\n\"For someone to make that change and make it so publicly to a new sport is so brave and she’s been extremely inquisitive this year, trying to learn the game.\n\n\"It’s been incredible to watch her, seeing how she trains and how she conducts herself, how she has switched over to being a rugby player because that’s what she is.\n\n\"She is an amazing rugby player and I think if she had another few months, I’d back her all the way because she has come on leaps and bounds.\n\n\"Hopefully she stays around, and we can see her in the next Olympic cycle and the series next year because I think she is one to watch.\"\n\nFollow the RTÉ Sport WhatsApp channel for the best news, interviews, analysis and features, as well as details of our sports coverage across all RTÉ platforms.\n\n \n\n© RTÉ 2025.

He noted it was \"perfect timing\" since the WNBA has the next month off for the Paris Olympics.\n\nMartin, who spent five years at Iowa and was a key component of the team's back-to-back Final Four trips in 2023 and 2024, is in the middle of her rookie year in the WNBA with the Las Vegas Aces. She has carved out a bench role for the two-time defending league champions, averaging 3.4 points per game off the bench across 23 appearances.\n\nMartin fell to the ground with 1:19 remaining in the first quarter Tuesday in the Aces' home game against the Chicago Sky. She did not re-enter the game but did return to the bench to support her teammates.\n\nLas Vegas rookie Kate Martin suffered an injury to her lower right leg late in the first quarter Tuesday and will not return, the Aces said.\n\nLas Vegas ultimately lost the game, 93-85.\n\nIt's unclear if Martin will miss further time. The team said she suffered a lower right leg injury.\n\nThe Aces have a full month before their next game due to the league's All-Star break coinciding with this year's Olympics. Martin's next chance to suit up will be Aug. 17 vs. the New York Liberty.\n\nHearst Television participates in various affiliate marketing programs, which means we may get paid commissions on editorially chosen products purchased through our links to retailer sites."

To cheers and applause, she led a group of about 100 officials, athletes and local people by donning a swimsuit and taking a dip in the river after a barrage of tests showed it was finally safe.\n\n“It’s a dream day … and the sun is out,” Hidalgo said after performing a respectable crawl 100 metres downstream in water measured at 20C (68F). “It’s sweet and wonderful and the result of a lot of work. I remember at the very beginning in 2015 when we began our campaign for the Games, the international triathlon federation said why not a triathlon in the Seine? Will athletes be able to swim in the Seine? Today we can say they can.”\n\nTony Estanguet, the president of the Paris 2024 organising committee, congratulated city hall and the French authorities for making the river safe for swimming. “Today we have confirmation that the Seine is swimmable and that the triathlon and marathon swimming competitions can take place in it,” he said.\n\n“As organisers we’re very happy to be able to offer athletes the best conditions … but over and above that what is at play is using the Games to speed up the transformation of the city and make it possible to swim in the Seine.”\n\nHe added that in the case of heavy rain, which could risk a spike in water pollution, contingency plans had been drawn up to postpone races for “a few days”.\n\nSwimming in the Seine, which bisects Paris, has been banned since 1923 owing to health risks. In 1990, the then mayor of Paris, Jacques Chirac, promised to make it clean enough to swim in, but failed.\n\nHidalgo’s historic swim, which was postponed twice because of fluctuating pollution levels, came just 10 days before the opening of the Games on 26 July and after fears a large cleanup operation had failed. The work included the construction of a €1.4bn (£1.2bn) holding and treatment tank to contain bacteria-laden stormwater during heavy rains, which came into operation a month ago, and improvements to the city’s wastewater network.\n\nUntil very recently, the river was still failing water quality tests for E coli bacteria– an indicator of faecal matter – and showing levels above the upper limits imposed by sports federations.\n\nTriathlon events will be held on 30, 31 July and 5 August, and a swimming marathon on 8 and 9 August. The paratriathlon will take place on 1 and 2 September.\n\nCompetitors in the open-water swimming events and triathlon will set off at Pont Alexandre III, a marvel of 19th-century engineering near the foot of the Champs-Élysées, with the Eiffel Tower in the background.\n\nThe water will be tested regularly at several points before each event and authorities are certain it will be clean with 75% of identified bacterial pollution eliminated.\n\nParis Olympic organisers have said that if heavy rain during the Games affects pollution levels in the river, the triathlon would no longer feature the swimming portion – and the marathon swimming competition would be relocated.\n\nAs another sign of hope, French experts have identified more than 30 species of fish in the Seine in Paris, compared with three in 1970.\n\nAfter her swim, Hidalgo said making the Seine swimmable would also help the city adapt to the climate crisis and mitigate the pollution of the ocean into which the river flows."

Swimmer Penny Oleksiak, who has seven to her name, and sprinter Andre De Grasse, who owns six, are each making a third Olympic appearance.\n\nThe Games begin on July 26 – with some preliminary competitions on July 24 – and continue through Aug. 11. They will feature 329 events across 32 sports, many contested at venues held alongside famous Paris landmarks, from the River Seine to the Eiffel Tower and Roland Garros. The athletes will return to normalcy, after the Tokyo Games in 2021 was a year delayed by the pandemic, then held without fans and under strict restrictions.\n\n“The Paris 2024 Olympic Games have been long anticipated, both by athletes and fans,” said Bruny Surin, Olympic champion and Team Canada’s Paris 2024 chef de mission. “The atmosphere promises to be unique and festive.”\n\nCanada’s team is slightly smaller than the group that competed in Tokyo, which had 370 athletes, including eight squads qualifying in team sports. Canada is sending six teams to Paris. Those include the defending women’s soccer champions, a women’s basketball team and the first men’s basketball squad to play at a Summer Games since 2000 – a group boasting 11 NBA players, from Shai Gilgeous-Alexander to Jamal Murray.\n\nSome experts have estimated Canada could collect approximately 20 medals in Paris, projected on the strength of Canadians who have thrived on the world stage in recent years, including 800-metre runner Marco Arop, judoka Christa Deguchi and 17-year-old swimming sensation Summer McIntosh.\n\nCanada earned 24 medals in Tokyo, its most at a non-boycotted Summer Games. That was 11th among all countries competing, and included seven golds, seven silvers and 10 bronzes.\n\nOf the 338-strong delegation, 22 are alternates who will travel to Paris ready to step in at a moment’s notice. The Canadian athletes hail from nine different provinces – all but Newfoundland and Labrador – the most from Ontario (141), Quebec (58) and British Columbia (45).\n\nCanada will compete in 3×3 basketball, BMX freestyle, and surfing for the first time at an Olympics – all sports that made their Olympic debuts at Tokyo 2020. In Paris, Breaking will debut, featuring gold-medal contender Philip Kim of Canada.\n\nTeam Canada has full teams in men’s and women’s artistic gymnastics for the first time since Athens 2004. Canada is sending full teams in all three equestrian events for the first time since London 2012.\n\nDressage rider Jill Irving (61) is the oldest Olympian on Canada’s team; while 14-year-old park skateboarder Fay DeFazio Ebert is the youngest.\n\nThe athlete with the most Olympic appearances to their credit is table tennis player Mo Zhang, as Paris 2024 will be her fifth straight Games.\n\nOther notables Canadians will recognize include pro-tennis stars Félix Auger-Aliassime, Bianca Andreescu, Milos Raonic and Leylah Fernandez; plus golfers Brooke Henderson, Corey Conners and Nick Taylor.\n\nThe COC will have a Canada Olympic House for the first time since the 2018 Winter Olympics in Pyeongchang, a home away from home for Team Canada athletes and their families, as well as for fans.\n\n“These Games mark a return to the full scale of the Games we haven’t had the opportunity to experience in a long time,” said Eric Myles, the COC’s chief sport officer. “From packed stadiums and having families and friends on hand, to being able to welcome the world to Canada Olympic House, Paris 2024 will be a moment to cherish for us all.”\n\nReport an editorial error\n\nReport a technical issue\n\nEditorial code of conduct\n\nAuthors and topics you follow will be added to your personal news feed in Following.\n\n© Copyright 2025 The Globe and Mail Inc.

Many expected the Paris Olympics to be Nadal's final flourish as a professional tennis player but the Games finish two weeks before play gets underway at Flushing Meadows.\n\nNadal has won the US Open four times previously - most recently in 2019 - but he was forced to sit out last year's tournament due to injury. Currently sitting 261st in the world, the 38-year-old is on the men's singles entry list courtesy of his protected ranking.\n\nSome players are granted protected rankings by the ATP after extended periods of absence, whether due to injury or other reasons, to allow them to compete in tournaments they likely would have qualified for before they were sidelined.\n\nNadal missed the vast majority of the 2023 season after injuring a hip flexor at the Australian Open and later undergoing keyhole surgery. The Spaniard's injury woes caused him to miss the US Open last year for the first time since 2004.\n\nDenis Shapovalov, Reilly Opelka and Pablo Carreno Busta are among the other players on the men's side of the draw to benefit from a protected ranking, with the event at Flushing Meadows starting on August 26.\n\n\n\nNadal made his long-awaited Grand Slam return at the French Open in May. But the king of Roland-Garros landed a difficult first-round draw and was dumped out by Alexander Zverev in straight sets.\n\nThe 22-time Grand Slam champion sat Wimbledon out with a view to competing in other tournaments towards the end of this season. Nadal has kept the specifics of his retirement plans under wraps, repeatedly stating that this will probably be his last year as a pro while refusing to rule out a return to the French Open in 2025.\n\nTo many, the Paris Olympics at Roland-Garros feels like a natural end point, but that will not be the case if he competes at the US Open in August and September. Nadal returned to the court at the Nordea Open this week.\n\nWe use your sign-up to provide content in ways you've consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

Despite the city’s efforts to clean up the long-polluted river, the water has tested unsafe for humans in recent weeks, and cleaner on other days. The Games run from July 26-Aug. 11.\n\nTo clean up the river, Paris invested 1.4 billion euros ($1.5 billion) in building infrastructure to catch more stormwater when it rains — the same water that contains bacteria-laden wastewater that enters the river during periods of heavy rain and makes it unsafe to swim in.\n\nFILE - A man walks in the Austerlitz wastewater and rainwater storage basin, which is intended to make the Seine River swimmable during the Olympic Games, in Paris, during its inauguration May 2, 2024. (Stephane de Sakutin/Pool Photo via AP, File)\n\n\n\nIn May, Paris officials inaugurated a giant underground water storage basin next to the Austerlitz train station aimed at collecting excess rainwater and stopping wastewater from entering the Seine. The basin can hold the equivalent of 20 Olympic swimming pools of dirty water that will now be treated and is the centerpiece of major infrastructure improvements that the city has rushed to finish in time for the Games, but to also ensure that Parisians have a cleaner Seine in years to come.\n\n2024 Paris Olympics:\n\nBut a few spells of heavy rain could push E. coli levels beyond the limit of 900 colony-forming units per 100 milliliters that the World Triathlon Federation has determined as safe for competitions.\n\n“The Seine is not a special case,” said Metin Duran, a professor of civil and environmental engineering at Villanova University who has researched stormwater management. “It really is a complicated and very costly problem.” \n\n\n\n\nParis, like many old cities around the world, has a combined sewer system, which means that the city’s wastewater and stormwater flow through the same pipes. With heavy or prolonged periods of rain, the pipes’ capacity is reached, which means raw wastewater flows into the river instead of a treatment plant.\n\n\n\n\nOn a daily basis, the monitoring group Eau de Paris has tested the river water, yielding results that showed unsafe E. coli levels in recent weeks followed by results in early July that showed improvement. \n\nParis Olympic organizers have said that if heavy rain affects the Seine’s flow during the Games, the triathlon would no longer feature the swimming portion — and the marathon swimming competition would be relocated to the Vaires-sur-Marne Nautical Stadium in the greater Paris region.\n\nFILE - Athletes swim in the Seine river on the first leg of the women’s triathlon test event for the 2024 Paris Olympics in Paris, Aug. 17, 2023. In 2024. (AP Photo/Michel Euler, File)\n\n\n\n“It’s not very common, but it has happened a few times,” said Ollala Cernuda, head of communications at World Triathlon, an international body for the sport, about the possibility of the swim portion being cancelled.\n\n“And it’s always linked with water quality issues,” Cernuda said.\n\nBut organizers remain optimistic that drier, sunnier weather than what the French capital experienced in June will allow the events to go as planned — buffeted by the infrastructure upgrades. The sun’s ultraviolet rays kill bacteria like E. coli in water.\n\nAn AP analysis of weather data showed that in 2024, Paris has seen the second-most days with rain than any year since 1950, surpassed only by 2016.\n\nImportantly for the Seine’s water quality, there have also been few stretches of days without rain. \n\nParis only experienced one weeklong dry spell this year — in early June, whereas between 1950 and 2020, it was typical for the city to have at least three such periods by the end of June, according to the analysis.\n\nFILE - A worker walks in a tunnel linked to the water storage tank under construction for the Seine River, Nov. 29, 2023, in Paris. (AP Photo/Aurelien Morissard, File)\n\n\n\n“Predictions of rainfall have become much more accurate up to a week in advance,” said Jennifer Francis, a scientist at the Woodwell Climate Research Center in Massachusetts. “But the seasonal patterns of past decades no longer provide reliable guidance in our warmer world.” \n\nWith the Games approaching, the feverish debate over the cleanliness of the Seine River has become a source of frustration for some athletes like Léonie Périault, a French triathlete who won a bronze medal in the 2020 Tokyo Olympics. \n\n“Every time I meet someone, they worry that I’m going to swim in the Seine,” Périault said. “But I’ve been swimming in this river for several years now. In youth competitions, we swam regularly in the Seine and never had problems.”\n\nLast year, Périault took part in a test event in the Seine.\n\n“The setting was incredible with the Eiffel Tower as a backdrop and the water conditions were not worse than anywhere else in the world,” she said.\n\nFILE - Barges cruise on the Seine River near the Eiffel Tower during a rehearsal for the 2024 Paris Olympic opening ceremony, June. 17, 2024, in Paris. (AP Photo/Thomas Padilla, File)\n\n\n\nOn Saturday, the French Sports Minister Amélie Oudéa-Castéra took a plunge to demonstrate that the famed river is clean enough. Paris Mayor Anne Hidalgo has also said she would swim in the Seine this week.\n\nDan Angelescu, the founder and CEO of Fluidion, a Paris and Los Angeles-based water-monitoring tech company, said there have been improvements observed in the river since the city’s new infrastructure came online, but that the Seine’s water quality remained fragile. His company has measured the Seine’s contamination levels for several years.\n\nAngelescu said it’s hard to predict, using previous years’ data, what might happen later this month — since the water storage basin and other infrastructure were not operational until a few months ago.\n\n“It’s difficult to tell,” Angelescu said, speaking in early July after the Seine’s water had tested cleaner than in several weeks prior.\n\n“To see such a drastic improvement and so rapidly could be a sign that something is working,” he said. \n\n___\n\nAP journalist Mary Katherine Wildeman in Hartford, Conn., contributed to this report.

(AP Photo/Kirsty Wigglesworth, File)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNevin Harrison’s dreams came true in Tokyo when she won the inaugural Olympic women’s canoe sprint 200 at age 19.\n\nMuch of what followed the American’s gold-medal moment has seemed more like a nightmare.\n\nThe Seattle native fought through chronic lower back pain that made it hard for her to get out of bed at times last summer. She has dealt with a hamstring injury and had issues with her previous coach. As her results fell short of boosted expectations, she said some questioned if she would be a one-hit wonder.\n\n“Once you have a big accomplishment like that, it becomes everybody’s business instead of just yours,” she said.\n\nShe said a sports psychologist helped her, and now she’s back and ready to go for the Paris Olympics with a new coach in Joseph Harper. She said she wants to do this right.\n\n“There was no other person that was going to get me to where I wanted to be,” said Harrison, now 22. “And if I continued in that negative headspace and really was just a complete mess, that I wasn’t going to reach my goals. And then I was going to kind of waste all this time chasing after something that I was blowing for myself.”\n\nDoing it right, she believes, includes making another run at gold. She wants to do it all again, with the benefit of the wisdom she’s gained in the past three years. \n\n“I think a good motivator is knowing the feeling of how it feels to win a gold,” she said. “It’s not like, ‘It would be so amazing to do that.’ It’s like, I know exactly how that felt, and that’s exactly how I want to feel again. So it’s kind of like knowing the feeling that I’m searching for, which is helpful.”\n\n\n\n\nHarrison said the lead-up to this Olympics is much different. She said there is more pressure this time, but she’s learned to embrace the attention.\n\nHarper said Harrison became a victim of her success. She knocked off Canada’s Laurence Vincent Lapointe, a multiple-time world champion, to win in 2021. Harper said Harrison’s strong performance in the upset motivated the competition.\n\n“She raised the bar so high with her performance in Tokyo that it’s her fault that it’s not as easy as it was,” Harper said. “I’m not saying it was easy, but it’s her, fault that all the other girls in the world are now trying to get to the bar that she raised too. And a lot of them have reached these newer heights.”\n\nHarper said Harrison remains among the world’s best because of her power and explosiveness, coupled with a rare work ethic.\n\nIt hasn’t been all bad for Harrison since winning the gold – she won the world championship in the 200 sprint in 2022, qualified for the U.S. Olympic quota spot by finishing fourth at the 2023 world championships and won the U.S. Olympic trials in March. \n\nHarper said Harrison knows how to “turn on the game face” and believes she is a threat to win in Paris.\n\n“She’s very, very determined that way,” he said. “Like, second place is not an option for her. I think a common theme of all the greats in all the different sports is people say that athlete hates to lose. Nobody likes to lose. But the greats hate to lose with a passion.”\n\n___\n\nAP Olympics https://apnews.com/hub/2024-paris-olympic-games\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCopyright 2025 The Associated Press. All Rights Reserved."

Born in a poor village in Friesland, in the Netherlands, Dillema grew up in a bed she shared with three of her sisters. To earn money for her family, she began working as a domestic servant before she was even a teenager. By the time she was 22, however, she had set out on a path to bigger things: That year, she shocked sports watchers when she ran the 100-meter sprint in 12.7 seconds. Dutch officials whispered that she could reach the Olympics.\n\nHer first major event, two years later, was the European Championships—a pre-Olympic event governed by the track-and-field association, the International Amateur Athletic Federation (today’s World Athletics). Dillema seemed likely to sweep. There was just one problem. The IAAF had a new policy on the books requiring that all women receive a doctor’s note validating that they were “female” before they could compete. The test was crude and hardly scientific, involving stripping before a gynecologist. When Dillema refused to sit for a sex test, the Dutch Athletic Union summarily disqualified her. A representative told the press that “due to a medical condition Foekje would never be able to compete again.” It would take decades for Dutch sports fans to discover that their rising star disappeared from sports not because of an injury or an illness but because of a sex test. To protect her privacy, Dutch officials had simply kept the incident quiet.\n\nToday you’re probably familiar with a few high-profile athletes who’ve been disqualified from the Olympics over sex testing: Caster Semenya, perhaps Dutee Chand. But the athletes whose names we know about represent only a tiny sliver of the women and transfeminine people disqualified under the Olympics’ sex-testing policies. Stories like Dillema’s are likely much more widespread than we realize—cases of athletes on the rise who are quietly sidelined out of sports for failing or refusing a sex test. The evidence in the archives suggests, in fact, that sex testing had bearing not just on the Olympics; these mandates actively shaped who could make it in even the lower rungs of the sporting world. Countless women like Dillema were pushed aside long before they could even get to that hallowed highest competition. And as we approach the 33rd games this summer in Paris, that history of disqualification should give us pause. Sex testing has not only denied immensely talented athletes a chance to appear before fans, but also enshrined a troubling precedent of surveillance into sport itself.\n\n“I think it goes pretty deep,” Lindsay Parks Pieper, a professor of sports management at the University of Lynchburg and the author of Sex Testing: Gender Policing in Women’s Sports, told me over the phone. “I have concerns that there are a lot more individuals who were disqualified before they even made it to [the Olympics].”\n\nPart of the difficulty in knowing is the total secrecy of disqualifications. After sports federations publicly expelled Poland’s Ewa Kłobukowska in 1967 for failing a chromosome test, they adopted a policy of strict confidentiality. Athletes would be tested ahead of the Olympics, and if they failed, they would be sent home without comment. The rule was about protecting privacy, but it had the effect of rendering the real scope of sex testing invisible.\n\nWhen I started researching my book, The Other Olympians, on the origins of sex testing and the way it informs the contemporary battle over trans and intersex people in sport, I had hoped to pull together data on just how many athletes have been affected by these policies. I was surprised to learn that no such number exists. We do have the estimate, based on population-level genealogical patterns and not hard evidence, that 1 in every 504 Olympic athletes has failed a sex test. But the International Olympic Committee has never publicly acknowledged how many athletes it disqualified for failing to meet its highly subjective (and ever-changing) definition of female. What seems like a simple question—how many people had their careers cut short because of sex tests?—is apparently unanswerable.\n\n\n      By Michael Waters. Farrar, Straus and Giroux.\n    \n\n\n    Slate receives a commission when you purchase items using the links on this page.\n    Thank you for your support.\n  \n\nWhat we know, however, doesn’t look good. The first type of disqualification is the better documented kind: the athletes who made it all the way to international competitions only to be dismissed for failing a sex test right before they could compete. The archival evidence suggests that these cases were more common than the public has ever really known. In one tantalizing letter written in 1967, David Burghley—the head of the IAAF—proudly stated that at the European Championships, the IAAF had “managed to keep out six who were hermaphrodites” and was on track to “frighten the doubtful ones away.” Who were those athletes? We don’t know their names.\n\nI found other letters like this in the International Olympic Committee archives. A document outlining sex tests at the 1972 Olympics in Sapporo, Japan, implies that one athlete of the 217 who were tested failed the test. Pieper, meanwhile, located a letter she shared with me from IOC Medical Commission member Eduardo Hay. In 1981 Hay wrote that he knew of “about a dozen cases” of athletes failing sex tests over the past decade and a half. Rather than broadcast that they had failed the test, these athletes simply faked an injury and left their sports. Hay later said—seemingly guessing—that the number of disqualified athletes was around “one to two per Olympics.”\n\nRose Eveleth, host of the new podcast Tested, which explores the history of sex testing in elite sports, told me that many Olympic athletes knew of people who were dismissed for failing a test. “The athletes we talked to, all of them knew at least one person who had been sent home,” Eveleth said. “We talked to an athlete named Debbie Brill, who is a Canadian athlete. She said that she knew several women who were told to go home at the 1970 Commonwealth Games and then later at the Olympics.”\n\nYet the effects of sex-testing policies go much deeper than just the Olympic hopefuls who were turned away. The true goal of the project was a kind of trickle-down enforcement: In 1968 Alexandre de Mérode, the head of the IOC Medical Commission, assuredly reported that at that year’s Olympics, “there were several competitors who stayed home rather than risk being checked.” Sex testing wasn’t solely about keeping already high-achieving intersex and trans women from competing in the Olympics. It was a punitive policy designed to discourage intersex and trans women from ever attempting to pursue elite sports in the first place. The tests, in other words, were a big, flashing sign that they weren’t welcome.\n\nThere’s plenty of evidence that it worked. Sometime in the 1980s, a sports doctor reached out to Albert de la Chapelle, a Finnish geneticist who had repeatedly criticized the IOC’s sex-testing policies, and told him a disconcerting story. A young female skier, de la Chapelle learned, was given a chromosome test and determined to be ineligible because she was found to have XY chromosomes (as part of androgen insensitivity syndrome). “Her coach had told her she should not try to make a career in skiing, and I could do little to help her, because she would indeed always ‘fail’ in the IOC’s tests,” de la Chapelle wrote in a letter to de Mérode. He relayed this because to him the story felt symbolic. “This woman represents the invisible part of the iceberg: those numerous unfortunate women who are subjected to sex chromatin screening and eliminated from sports long before they reach a major competition.” De la Chapelle knew enough to understand that the skier was far from alone in that regard. “There must be hundreds if not thousands of women who have been silently shuffled aside this way,” he said.\n\nWhen Pieper discovered this letter in the archives, it unsettled her. For decades, certain federations have tested even teenage athletes, effectively cutting short their careers if—for one reason or another—a test flagged them as insufficiently female. Pieper told me she has been researching the archives of the volleyball federation, the Fédération Internationale de Volleyball. According to the professor, the FIVB began sex testing adult athletes in 1974. “By 1977, they were testing at the Juniors,” Pieper said. The FIVB even had suggestions for what young athletes should do if they failed a sex test. When results were inconclusive, the FIVB told federations, “those athletes should fake an injury or pretend to be sick,” Pieper said. More recently, Eveleth pointed me toward the former professional golfer Kendra Little, who identifies as intersex and who decided to quit golf rather than face down the inevitable scrutiny about her gender.\n\nThat many young athletes—trans, intersex, or cis—may have been, for decades, pulled out of elite sports for failing sex tests is already troubling. But it is especially damaging when you consider how astonishingly subjective the tests themselves were. The sexed nature of the human body exists on a spectrum: As one endocrinologist put it to journalist Katie Barnes, sex is the result of the complex “interplay and the collective of your sex chromosomes, sex hormones, your internal reproductive structures, and what gonads you have, and your external genitalia.” Yet sports officials have, since 1936, invented and reinvented ways to enforce a strict binary anyway. The first rendition of sex testing involved crude gynecological exams, like the one Dillema refused to take part in. By the 1960s, sports officials embraced chromosome testing, but this too received criticism from scientists. It wasn’t uncommon for someone to have a difference in sex development, for example, and never even know it. The pivot to hormone testing presents its own problems, seeing as all women have a natural range of testosterone levels.\n\nToday, these long-running efforts to keep trans and intersex women out of sports have become a mainstream political weapon. Twenty-three states now restrict the ability of trans girls and women to participate in school sports. It is the more explicit and draconian version of what has been playing out, again and again, throughout competitive sports for over half a century: Trans and intersex athletes, and potentially others who failed these highly subjective tests, are being pushed out of sports before they even get a chance to become stars.\n\nIf there is a lesson the history can offer us, it is that these policies have a way of hiding their casualties. Just because we don’t know the names of the girls who are told to fake an injury and never play again doesn’t mean that it’s not happening. But while understanding the scope of the damage can sharpen a critique of these policies, we shouldn’t get too lost in the math. Sex testing is inhumane, whether it affects four people or 4,000.\n\n“There’s something about the numbers game that I always sort of struggle with because, like, how many people need to go through this in order for it to be not OK?” Eveleth said. Sex testing, they noted, “is the canary in the coal mine for what we’re allowing people to tell us about ourselves. That this organization and their scientists and doctors can tell you who you are,” they said, referring to athletic federations—that is a dark signal of our times no matter what. For it to matter, “there doesn’t need to be 1,000 impacted by that.”\n\nSlate is published by The Slate\n          Group, a Graham Holdings Company.\n\nAll contents ©\n        2025\n        The Slate Group LLC.

Mandatory Credit: Jerome Miron-USA TODAY Sports\n\nFirst Kawhi Leonard‘s withdrawal and then selecting Derrick White over Jaylen Brown — controversies have recently surrounded Team USA. Notably, the initial reports of Leonard’s departure from the Olympics roster mentioned the move as a joint decision on Team USA and the Los Angeles Clippers’ end because of The Klaw‘s knee injury last season. However, Clippers President Lawrence Frank has now stated the decision is completely on Team USA. In fact, he stated both his franchise and Leonard wanted him to play at the Olympics.\n\nAmid all of this, Leonard was facing criticism for withdrawing from the team despite injury not being the reason. But the 6x All-Star has now received Jeff Teague’s support as the clouds of controversies loom over Team USA. “And my knee ain’t even 100% really, like, I really. I’m chilling, bro. You got it,” the 2001 NBA champ said on the Club 520 podcast.\n\nHis co-host pointed out how Leonard pulled up for the summer camp for three days and then rode back, so he basically did what he wanted to. “And I love it. He stand on business. He do whatever he want. I love that,” Teague further added. It is worth mentioning that earlier, former NBA star Gilbert Arenas had criticized USA Basketball for not revealing complete information on Leonard’s reason for not playing.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nArticle continues below this ad\n\nThe USABMNT’s report had previously stated, “Kawhi has been ramping up for the Olympics over the past several weeks and had a few strong practices in Las Vegas. He thought he was prepared to fight.” However, Gil, on his podcast, countered this report by referring to pictures posted by the Clippers’ journalist Joey Linn. The photos featured the 2x NBA champ having a good time on his Costa Rica trip.\n\nUSA Today via Reuters\n\nOct 2, 2023; Los Angeles, CA, USA; Los Angeles Clippers forward Kawhi Leonard (2) poses for photos during media day at the Honey Training Center in Playa Vista, CA.

In Costa Rica, we managed to catch him lounging. So for a couple of weeks? You’re lying,” Arenas said. But before this controversy could settle down, a new one emerged, with Derrick White being chosen over Jaylen Brown.\n\nThe discussion emerged on the Club 520 Podcast as well, with the opinion that the reason Brown is not on the USA Team is because of marketing and brand situations. Questions on White’s eligibility and requirements on the team were also put into question. However, some crew members of the podcast believe White could provide an Andre Iguodala-like contribution to the team.\n\nBut the controversy around White over Brown is bigger than just eligibility issues. The speculations are that since Brown has criticized Nike in the past; the brand is involved in Brown not making it to the Olympics roster. Notably, Nike is a key sponsor for the USA’s basketball team. On being asked about the possibility of a foul play on Nike’s end, even Jaylen has raised suspicion. “I do for sure. There will be more stuff to come with that. As of now, I’m not gonna comment on it,” he said.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nArticle continues below this ad\n\nIs Kawhi Leonard the most underrated player in the NBA despite his stellar performances?\n\nDebate\n\nApart from this, the contradiction in Clippers’ President Lawrence and USA Basketball’s statements also raises doubt. Kawhi Leonard was once involved in a legal battle with Nike over the copyright ownership of the ‘Klaw’ logo. Amid all such circumstances, developments in Team USA’s roster have raised many eyebrows.\n\nStay tuned for more such updates.

That was at another major tournament – in the semi-finals of the 2022 Birmingham Commonwealth Games.\n\n“Nerves came into play when they faced the tricky English pair at the Commonwealth Games. The pressure will be great as they are expected to win. They just have to keep their cool,” said Boon Heong.\n\nThe biggest hurdle for the Malaysians are the Chinese hotshots Weikeng-Wang Chang.\n\nJust chill: Tan Boon Heong says Aaron Chia-Soh Wooi Yik have a relatively better draw.\n\n“They are doing really great as one of the most consistent pairs, but they are not unbeatable,” said Boon Heong.\n\n“Groupings in Olympics are quite tactical, I hope our boys will stay focused to clear their group stage.”\n\nAaron-Wooi Yik have only won two of their last eight meetings against the fast-attacking Weikeng-Wang Chang. Only two pairs in each group will advance to the semis.\n\nMeanwhile, Boon Heong said the Badminton World Federation’s (BWF) decision to allow 17 men’s pairs instead of the usual 16, was an unavoidable situation.\n\nFrench pair Ronan Labar-Lucas Corvee had successfully disputed a BWF decision via the Court of Arbitration of Sports (CAS) after the world body miscalculated the ranking points and allowed Popov brothers Christo-Toma of France to qualify instead of Labar-Corvee. CAS however, ordered BWF to include the French pair.\n\n“It’s unfair to have one extra pair as others have been really fighting hard to qualify for the Games,” said Boon Heong. “But again, it’s also unfair to Ronan-Lucas if they are not allowed to play because BWF made the mistake. It does not seem right, but everyone will just have to accept it.”\n\nTHE DRAW\n\nGroup A: Liang Weikeng-Wang Chang (Chn), Aaron Chia-Soh Wooi Yik (Mas), Ben Lane-Sean Vendy (Eng) and Adam Dong-Nyl Yakura (Can).\n\nGroup B: Kang Min-hyuk-Seo Seung-jae (Kor), Christo Popov-Toma Popov (Fra), Supak Jomkoh-Kittinupong Kedren (Tha), Ondrej Kral-Adam Mendrek (Cze).\n\nGroup C: Satwiksairaj Rankireddy-Chirag Shetty (Ind), Ronan Labar-Lucas Corvee (Fra), Fajar Alfian-Muhammad Rian Ardianto (Ina), Mark Lamsfuss-Marvin Seidel (Ger).\n\nGroup D: Kim Astrup-Anders Skaarup Rasmussen (Den), Liu Yuchen-Ou Xuanyi (Chn), Lee Yang-Wang Chi-lin (Tpe), Takuro Hoki-Yugo Kobayashi (Jpn), and Vinson Chiu-Joshua Yuan (US)\n\n \n\nThank you for your report!\n\nCopyright © 1995-\n            \n\n Star Media Group Berhad [197101000523 (10894-D)]\n\nBest viewed on Chrome browsers.\n\n\n\nWe would love to keep you posted on the latest promotion.

Even sports, we can’t do them anymore”: Violations of Muslim women’s and girls’ human rights through hijab bans in sports in France, details the devastating impact that hijab bans are having on Muslim women and girls at all levels of French sport.\n\n“Banning French athletes from competing with sports hijabs at the Olympic and Paralympic Games makes a mockery of claims that Paris 2024 is the first Gender Equal Olympics and lays bare the racist gender discrimination that underpins access to sport in France,” said Anna Błuś, Amnesty International’s Women’s Rights Researcher in Europe.\n\nDiscriminatory rules policing what women wear are a violation of Muslim women’s and girls’ human rights and have a devastating impact on their participation in sport, blocking efforts to make sports more inclusive and more accessible\n\n“Discriminatory rules policing what women wear are a violation of Muslim women’s and girls’ human rights and have a devastating impact on their participation in sport, blocking efforts to make sports more inclusive and more accessible.” \n\nHijab bans in multiple sports in France have created an untenable situation whereby the country hosting the Olympic Games is in breach of multiple obligations under international human rights treaties to which it is a party as well as commitments and values set out in the IOC’s own human rights framework. Despite repeated demands, the IOC has so far refused to call on sporting authorities in France to overturn their bans on athletes wearing the hijab at the Olympics and at all levels of sport. In response to a letter from a coalition of organizations urging it to take action, the IOC claimed that France’s prohibition on sports hijabs was outside the remit of the Olympic movement, claiming that “freedom of religion is interpreted in many different ways by different states.”  The IOC’s response did not mention other rights violated by the ban, such as freedom of expression and access to health.\n\nFrance’s bans on sports headgear contradict the clothing rules of international sports bodies such as FIFA (International Football Federation), FIBA (International Basketball Federation) and FIVB (International Volleyball Federation). Amnesty International looked at rules in 38 European countries and found that France is the only one that has enshrined bans on religious headwear either on the level of national laws or individual sports regulations. \n\nHélène Bâ, a basketball player, told Amnesty International that the Olympics hijab ban “is a clear violation of the Olympic charter, values and provisions, and an infringement on our fundamental rights and freedoms…I think it’s going to be a shameful moment for France.”\n\nAnother woman, “B”, told Amnesty International: “It is sad. It’s even shameful to be at this point in 2024, to block dreams just because of a piece of fabric.” \n\nIn France, the prohibition on Muslim women from wearing any form of religious headgear extends far beyond the Olympic and Paralympic Games. Bans on hijabs are in place in several sports including football, basketball and volleyball, at both professional and amateur levels. These bans, put in place by sports federations, mean that many Muslim women are not only excluded from participating in sports but also never get the necessary training and competition opportunities to reach the Olympic level.           \n\nFrance’s exclusionary bans cause humiliation, trauma and fear and have resulted in many women and girls dropping out of sports they love or even seeking opportunities in other countries. Preventing Muslim women and girls from fully and freely participating in sports, for leisure and recreation or as a career, can have devastating impacts on all aspects of their lives, including on their mental and physical health. \n\nHélène Bâ, who hasn’t been allowed to compete in basketball since October 2023, told Amnesty International: “Mentally it is also hard because you really feel excluded…Especially if you go to the bench and the referee tells you to go to the ladders [stands]. Everyone sees you…it’s a walk of shame.”\n\nUnder international law, state neutrality or secularism (“laїcité”) are not legitimate reasons for imposing restrictions on freedom of expression and/or freedom of religion. And yet for several years, French authorities have been weaponizing these concepts to justify the enactment of laws and policies that disproportionately impact Muslim women and girls. And all of this is occurring against a backdrop relentless, twenty-year campaign of harmful lawmaking and regulation of Muslim women’s and girls’ clothing in France, fuelled by prejudice, racism and gendered Islamophobia.  \n\nFouné Diawara, co-President of the football collective the Hijabeuses, told Amnesty International: “Our fight is not political or religious but centred on our human right to participate in sports.” \n\nNo policymaker should dictate what a woman can or cannot wear and no woman should be forced to choose between the sport she loves and her faith, cultural identity, or beliefs\n\n“No policymaker should dictate what a woman can or cannot wear and no woman should be forced to choose between the sport she loves and her faith, cultural identity, or beliefs,” said Anna Błuś. \n\n“It is not too late for the French authorities, sports federations and the IOC to do the right thing and to overturn all bans on athletes wearing the hijab in French sport, both at the summer Olympics and in all sport, at all levels.” \n\nBackground\n\nOn 11 June, members of the Sport & Rights Alliance and Basket Pour Toutes published a letter written to the International Olympic Committee demanding that they publicly call on sporting authorities in France to overturn all bans on athletes wearing the hijab in French sport, both at Paris 2024 and at all times and all levels of sport. On 18 June, the IOC responded to the organisations.\n\nTogether we can fight for human rights everywhere. Your donation can transform the lives of millions.\n\n\n\nIf you are talented and passionate about human rights then Amnesty International wants to hear from you.\n\n© 2025 Amnesty International"

But we do and we can gain the ability to manage what shows up in our head,” Panuska said.\n\nVISUALIZATION AND MENTAL IMAGERY –  “Visualizing it shares a lot of the same neuro-physiological processes as actually doing it. And so, to the brain, it's like you've already done it. And then when you're in the moment, it's much smoother and cleaner. I find it to be one of the most underutilized strategies that I'll just everyday people can use,” Panuska said.\n\nFeeling out of the loop? We'll catch you up on the news you need to know with the Chicago Catch-Up newsletter.\n\nREGULATE YOUR NERVOUS SYSTEM – How? With deep breathing, including a technique called extended breathing. “If you extend your exhalation of your breath, that actually engages your parasympathetic nervous system, which is responsible for bringing your stress state down. So if you just extend that a little bit longer than your inhale, that will help get you back here like peak performance,” Panuska said.\n\nREPETITION MIXED WITH CUE WORDS – You’ve likely heard the phrase, “practice makes perfect.” Panuska said mixing in cue words while practicing helps you reset your brain. “The cue words, serve as sort of like a reset button, kind of snaps you back to your value and what's important moving forward.” He recommends you pick the words based on your personal values. “I've had somebody use the phrasing, “What's the point?” And to them, that helped kind of break their negative thinking,” Panuska said.\n\nWhile most of us aren’t going for gold like Simone Biles, these tips can help us get mentally fit to reach our goals, experts say.

Embiid mostly made simple, sound decisions out of those situations, though he did commit three turnovers in the game and had a few sloppy plays. \n\nJust about everyone besides Embiid on Team USA started hot Monday. Anthony Edwards was the brightest star early, posting 11 entertaining first-quarter points on 4-for-4 shooting. \n\nANT JUST DID THAT. 😮‍💨🇺🇸 #USABMNT x 📺 @FS1 pic.twitter.com/uSweeqes6X\n\n\n\nEmbiid, meanwhile, began 0 for 3 from the floor. One of those misses would’ve counted as two points in the NBA; he had a layup knocked off the cylinder just before it dropped. \n\nThe Sixers’ seven-time All-Star big man converted his first field goal late in the second quarter with a trailing, top-of-the-key three-pointer. \n\n1 through 5. They all got range.🇺🇸 #USABMNT x 📺 @FS1 pic.twitter.com/yWcv91n5fg\n\nHe later powered his way to the hoop against the scrambling Australian defense and scored a twisting and-one layup.

Team USA was subpar across the board for much of the final period. The Americans’ turnover problems and leaky defense helped the Boomers cut their deficit as low as four points in the closing seconds, but Australia couldn’t pull off a dramatic comeback. \n\nTeam USA’s third of five exhibition games is scheduled for Wednesday at 12 p.m. ET vs. Serbia in Abu Dhabi. \n\nThe Americans will play South Sudan on Saturday and face Germany next Monday before heading off to the Paris Olympics. "

However, he respects that USA Basketball and the Clippers determined it’s in his best interest to spend the remainder of the summer preparing for the upcoming season rather than participating in the Olympic Games in Paris.””(AP Photo/John Raoux, File)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLAS VEGAS (AP) — The Los Angeles Clippers had no problem with Kawhi Leonard playing for the U.S. in the Paris Olympics this summer and wanted him to remain on the team, general manager Lawrence Frank said Monday.\n\nUSA Basketball removed Leonard — whose NBA season was disrupted at the end because of a knee problem — from its roster last week after a four-day, four-practice training camp and replaced him with the Boston Celtics’ Derrick White. USA Basketball said that it and the Clippers determined that Leonard not playing this summer was in his best interest.\n\n“It was USAB’s call, and I was, quite frankly, very disappointed with the decision,” Frank told reporters in Las Vegas. “Kawhi wanted to play. We wanted him to play.”\n\nLeonard missed 12 of the Los Angeles Clippers’ final 14 games this past season with right knee inflammation, though he said last week that he felt fine and the knee was doing well. But USA Basketball — which has Clippers coach Tyronn Lue as an assistant on head coach Steve Kerr’s staff — felt differently.\n\nLeonard is a two-time NBA champion, six-time All-Star and six-time All-NBA player, but injury issues have been a recurring theme over the past seven seasons. USA Basketball had monitored him going into camp and USA Basketball managing director Grant Hill even watched a workout earlier this summer to check on Leonard’s health.\n\n“I was there the first two practices. He looked very good, was a full participant in everything that they did,” Frank said. “I wasn’t there for the third practice, where ultimately, that was the point where they decided to go in a different direction. I expressed then, I really wished that they would have given Kawhi more time.”\n\n\n\n\nThe U.S. has been without three-time gold medalist Kevin Durant since it convened in Las Vegas for camp earlier this month. Durant is with the team but did not play in either of its first two exhibitions — a win over Canada on July 10 and a win over Australia on Monday.\n\nIf a player on the 12-man roster is hurt during the Olympics, there’s no replacement option. That’s a major factor weighing on teams as they finalize their rosters before play starts in France later this month.\n\n“I understand USAB’s perspective that they have to look at what they feel is in the best interest of the team, despite what I think,” Frank said. “They’re also managing some other players who are dealing with injuries, so, I understand that they have to do what’s best. ... You have to move forward. We support USAB. Desperately want to see them win the gold medal. I know that’s how Kawhi feels, too.”\n\n___\n\nAP Summer Olympics: https://apnews.com/hub/2024-paris-olympic-games\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCopyright 2025 The Associated Press. All Rights Reserved."

The Boomers kept battling and twice trimmed the gap back to four, but the US held on.\n\nJock Landale led Australia’s scoring with 20 points, with strong contributions from Josh Giddey (17 points, eight rebounds, seven assists) and Dyson Daniels (14), but the form of Mills, preparing for his fifth Olympics, was an issue. Mills had only five points on two-of-eight shooting, and five turnovers, in 22 minutes – extending his shooting woes from the home series against China.\n\nAt 35, there are concerns about whether Mills can again have the kind of sustained impact the Boomers need from him if they to reach the medal rounds in Paris.\n\nBogut, speaking on NBL Media’s The Gold Standard podcast with fellow former Boomer Brad Newley, saying it was time for Mills to be an impact player off the bench.\n\n“Patty wasn’t great … Patty started very similarly the last couple of tournaments in the lead-ups and friendlies,” said Bogut of the 2014 NBA champion who’s now a member of the Miami Heat.\n\n“There are concerns, obviously, looking at the way he’s playing, but this has been kind of a story for him in lead-up games for tournaments, and then he has a great tournament … but they’re gonna need more from him.”\n\nBoomers icon Patty Mills tries to defend US star Jayson Tatum on a drive to the basket.Credit: AP\n\nNewley, a dual-Olympian, said Dante Exum, who enjoyed a strong World Cup last year, was the better option to start – a point Bogut agreed with.\n\n“I’m [of] a similar mind. I’d love to see Patty come off the bench and just play that kind of role,” Bogut said, noting coach Brian Goorjian was trying to split minutes between Mills and Giddey, the team’s primary playmaker.\n\nAustralia’s starting five were Giddey, Mills, Daniels, Nick Kay and Landale, all of them but the Japan-based Kay being NBA players. The US began with the elite quintet of Steph Curry, Joel Embiid, Jayson Tatum, LeBron James and Anthony Edwards – with seven NBA MVP awards and nine championships between them.\n\nJock Landale (contesting the tip-off with US star Joel Embiid) led the scoring for Australia in Abu Dhabi.Credit: Getty Images\n\nThe Australians scored a stunning 68 points in the paint, highlighting their interior strength, but perimeter shooting was again an issue, going 4-18 from three. Back-up guard Matthew Dellavedova – in a four-minute cameo – and reserve big man Will Magnay also impressed, while Jack McVeigh, celebrating a two-way NBA contract with the Houston Rockets, had nine points.\n\n“This [preparation] is great for us; [it’s] my fourth Olympics and I don’t think we’ve played a better basketball team than we’ve played tonight, man-for-man,” Boomers coach Goorjian said.\n\nThe USA’s depth was on show, highlighted by Haliburton, Jrue Holiday, Bam Adebayo, Anthony Davis and Devin Booker. That was the group on the floor when the Americans took a game that was tied at 19-19 with 3:15 left in the first and turned it into a 39-23 lead — a 20-4 run in a span of just over five minutes.\n\nBy half-time, it was 53-37.\n\n“The strength of our team is our depth and we have to utilise our depth,” US coach Steve Kerr said.\n\nThat extra quality showed in the willingness to shoot, and ability to land, threes. The US made 12 threes from 29 attempts (a 41.3 per cent mark).\n\nThe Boomers fought back by forcing turnovers, scoring 25 points off them in the second half alone.\n\n“[In the] third quarter, we started turning the ball over,” Kerr added.\n\n“We gave up a ton of points at the basket. The game shifted. It’s a good lesson for us.”\n\nFor the US, Davis scored 17 points and grabbed 14 rebounds, Booker had 16 points, Edwards 14 and James, Adebayo and Embiid 10 each.\n\nThe Boomers are due to meet Serbia in an exhibition game overnight (2am Wednesday AEST) in the UAE.\n\nWith AAP, AP\n\nSports news, results and expert commentary.

(ABC News: Mark Evans)\n\nGoing to the Olympics has been a dream of hurdler Alanah Yukich since she started athletics as a little girl. \n\nBut the moment she was told of her selection wasn't the fairytale she thought it would be. \n\n\"I actually didn't get the phone call that everyone got, I was actually asleep,\" she laughed from her Texas apartment.\n\n\"It was a big relief and it still hasn't fully hit me yet.\"\n\nThe 26-year-old is competing in Paris in just under two weeks and is representing a small but proud regional town in WA.\n\nYukich has been based in the US for the past five years, training and studying at the University of Texas in San Antonio – but turned her attention this year to qualifying for the Olympics.\n\nAfter graduating from college last year and finding a new coach, she set off to do just that.\n\nYukich first got into athletics when she was 13, and has loved competing ever since (Supplied)\n\n\"We got along so well so quickly and then pretty much planned out the year from there,\" she said.\n\n\"My first goal was the world relays which I was selected for and went to the Bahamas, so that was a little stepping stone in the direction of the Olympics.\"\n\nUnfortunately the team didn't qualify for the 4x400 metres relay, which Yukich said gave her \"more determination\" to qualify for herself instead in the 400 metre hurdles.\n\nYukich was one of five WA athletes chosen for the Australian Olympic athletics team.  (Supplied)\n\nWithin just 16 days, she hit five countries for five different races, with three of those races back-to-back.\n\n\"The hectic one was my three races in three days in three different countries. I hit Madrid, then Geneva, and then Poland,\" she said.\n\nAlanah Yukich after winning the 400m national under-17s title (Supplied)\n\nYukich recorded personal best after personal best across these world-ranking races.\n\nShe was able to run sub 56.00 seconds consistently during this last-minute Olympic dash, ultimately leading to her dream becoming a reality.\n\nBack home in Perth, the support has been flowing in for the young athlete.\n\n\"I called my parents pretty much as soon as they were awake in Perth and they were just so relieved as well. We've all been together in this process,\" she said.\n\nYukich grew up in the small WA town of Gingin north of Perth.  (Supplied)\n\n\"Until I see them in Paris when they come over to watch me, then I'll really take it in … I haven't been able to give them that big hug yet.\"\n\nYukich grew up in Gingin, 67 kilometres north of Perth.  It's a town with a population of just over 6,000 people.\n\nShe joked she \"did every sport possible to get out of farm work\" growing up with her brothers, but it wasn't until she went to high school that her love for athletics grew.\n\nYukich's mother Ineska and father Philip are making the big trip over to Paris from Perth with their two sons to see their daughter compete.\n\nPhilip and Ineska Yukich can't wait to see Alanah compete in Paris. (ABC News: Courtney Withers)\n\n\"I don't know if it's really hit me yet to think our daughter is actually going to the Olympics even though we've booked tickets and we're on the journey,\" Mrs Yukich said.\n\n\"I get emotional … I'm just really happy.\n\nMr Yukich said he was extremely proud of his daughter.\n\n\"Especially looking at all of these photos and bringing up everything in the past that is making it, because we've looked at the whole journey in one little sitting,\" Mr Yukich said.\n\nIt's a long way from the Kingsway Little Athletics Centre to Paris, but Alanah Yukich has made it. (ABC News: Courtney Withers)\n\nYukich said the support from everyone she's met along her journey has been \"overwhelming\" since she was allowed to publicly share the news last Monday.\n\n\"I had to turn my phone off and my notifications off,\" she laughed.\n\nThe 26-year-old holds the WA women's record for the 400m hurdles. (Supplied)\n\n\"The messages have been so lovely — people from primary school, people from my childhood, my old PE teacher that pushed me and always had faith in me.\n\n\"I come from a country background with a community that helped raise me, and to think that now I get to share this experience with them … it's beautiful.\"\n\nFor Yukich right now, it's back to training until her heats in Paris begin in early August.\n\nYukich will compete in her first racing heat in Paris on August 4th. (Instagram: Alanah Yukich)\n\nShe's off to compete in a race in Florida this week to keep her in the racing mode before heading to the athlete training camp in the south of France.\n\nBut she's most excited to represent regional WA and put on the green and gold.\n\n\"I've missed a lot of birthdays, I've missed a lot of weddings, I've missed my friend's pregnancies … you definitely second guess if this sport is something you want to do, having so much sacrifice,\" Yukich said.\n\nYukich's family will add Olympic mementos to their collection when they get back to Perth. (ABC News: Courtney Withers)\n\n\"When I eventually come back to Perth, it's going to be a great celebration and it's all going to be worth it.\n\n\"Anything is possible when you dream that young.\"\n\nFor more local stories and videos visit ABC Perth on Instagram.\n\nSelect \"Western Australia Top Stories\" from either the ABC News home page or the settings menu in the app.\n\nTopic:NRL\n\nTopic:Paralympic Games\n\nTopic:Sport\n\nTopic:Police\n\nTopic:State of Origin\n\nTopic:Health\n\nAnalysis by Patricia Karvelas\n\nTopic:Foreign Aid\n\nTopic:Alternative Energy\n\nTopic:Courts\n\nTopic:Sport\n\nTopic:Olympic Games\n\nTopic:Sport\n\nAthletics\n\nGeraldton\n\nGingin\n\nOlympic Games\n\nPerth\n\nSport\n\nTopic:Health\n\nAnalysis by Patricia Karvelas\n\nTopic:Foreign Aid\n\nTopic:Alternative Energy\n\nTopic:Courts\n\nTopic:World War 2\n\nTopic:Children's Health\n\nTopic:Activism and Lobbying\n\nTopic:Indigenous Culture\n\nWe acknowledge Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples as the First Australians and Traditional Custodians of the lands where we live, learn, and work.\n\nThis service may include material from Agence France-Presse (AFP), APTN, Reuters, AAP, CNN and the BBC World Service which is copyright and cannot be reproduced.\n\nAEST = Australian Eastern Standard Time which is 10 hours ahead of GMT (Greenwich Mean Time)"

Underdogs have won the title before, so we can’t rule anyone out.\n\nThe world No. 7 Zii Jia should have no problems getting past his group stage but could face the 2021 Tokyo Games bronze medallist Anthony in the last 16.\n\nThe head-to-head records is not in favour of Zii Jia as he has only beaten Anthony once in six meetings.If the professional wins, he will likely face Antonsen in the quarter-finals.\n\nIt will not get any easier for Zii Jia after that as world No. 1 Yuqi or Kunlavut will most probably await in the last four.\n\n“Zii Jia should not fear anyone but play with confidence to keep alive his hope to win a gold,” said Rashi.\n\n“He definitely has a chance of at least winning a medal.\n\n“Zii Jia has beaten all the top players before this, even defending champion Viktor, so this should give him confidence.\n\n“Based on form, he is now better than Anthony as he has won two titles (Thailand and Australian Open) while the Indonesian’s form has dropped lately.\n\n“Of course, Anthony can improve as all players will be well prepared in the Olympics but Zii Jia can beat him.\n\n“Zii Jia has beaten Antonsen before and can do so again. He needs to be well prepared mentally, physically and most importantly handle the pressure well,” added Rashid.\n\nWorld No. 2 Axelsen, who is in the bottom half of the draw, could set-up an intriguing clash against China’s reigning Asian Games gold medallist Li Shifeng in the last eight.\n\nShifeng must first beat Singapore’s 2021 world champion Loh Kean Yew in the round of 16.\n\nIn another interesting early tie, All-England champion Jonatan needs to overcome India’s 2022 Birmingham Commonwealth Games champion Lakshya Sen in Group L to make it to the round of 16.\n\nThank you for your report!\n\nCopyright © 1995-\n            \n\n Star Media Group Berhad [197101000523 (10894-D)]\n\nBest viewed on Chrome browsers.\n\n\n\nWe would love to keep you posted on the latest promotion.

When I got the top I was very happy. I’ll go back to Japan now and then it’s straight to the Olympics, and I’ll do my best there.”\n\nPilz did indeed top the route although the Austrian climber would have maybe preferred not to: “I’m super happy to be on the podium but it’s a bit annoying that we couldn’t have a really good fight in finals. I feel the route was a bit easy. I like to have a good fight. I would rather not top and have a good fight.\n\nWith the Olympic just around the corner, Pilz now heads back home with her new silverware: “I’ll go back to Innsbruck now for training ahead of the Olympics. I feel my Lead shape is good so I’m happy about that, but Boulder, sometimes it works out well and sometimes not. I still have a lot of weaknesses in Boulder and I will try to be in my best shape. I have two more weeks to train heard and then we will see if it works.”\n\nThere was a second Japanese climber on the podium with Kotake Mei joining Mori claiming bronze on hold 44+ to complete the medal honours.\n\nHome favourite, France’s Zélia Avezou produced a personal best finish also reaching hold 44+ but finishing fourth as Kotake had a better semi-final result.\n\nAustria’s Flora Oblasser also secured a personal best with the 16-year-old finishing fifth overall in her first senior final on hold 42+.\n\nThe third Austrian climber in the final lineup, Mattea Pötzi finished sixth, also on hold 42+. It was the first time Austria has had three finalists since Kranj 2018.\n\nOn hold 41+ USA’s Anastasia Sanders and Slovenia’s Mia Krampl completed the final standings finished seventh and eighth respectively.\n\nThe full women’s results can be found here\n\nUSA’s Colin Duffy won the second IFSC Lead World Cup gold of his career reaching hold 42+ for the win.\n\nWith that gold Duffy joins compatriots Jesse Grupper and Sean Bailey on two Lead World Cup wins – the most for the nation.\n\nTalking about his win Duffy said: “It feels amazing to get my second Lead World Cup gold. It’s been an incredible journey these past few years doing the World Cup circuit and finding another special moment on the wall. In qualification I didn’t feel the greatest on the wall, but I put that out of my mind and have a good climb in the final. And the crowd here is incredible.\n\nIt’s a perfect way to cap off my last competition before the Olympics. I’ve been training hard all year and to see I’m in the form I want to be is phenomenal and I’m going to stay here in France and train before Paris and I want to show my best there.”\n\nIn front of his home crowd, France’s Sam Avezou took a silver medal for the second successive year in Chamonix reaching hold 41+ to do so.\n\nReflecting on the medal Avezou said: “I’m feeling super good. Always in Chamonix I feel this way. The French crowd is exceptional, and I have my family and friends here so it’s always fun to climb here. I’m in a very good lead shape as well as Boulder so I wanted to get confident and do the best I could. I thought I could get a medal and I came so close to the gold, like one move away, but it’s still super good.”\n\nThe podium was completed with Great Britain’s Toby Roberts taking bronze after an appeal gave him a hold 39 climb, displacing Spain’s Alberto Ginés López who finally finished fourth on 38+.\n\nAfterwards Roberts said: “I feel really good after the final. It was a bit of a strange route as it wasn’t that hard until the head wall and then it really kicked in, but I’m happy with my shape and I really enjoy competing here in Chamonix. I was a bit hesitant on the head wall and I think if I didn’t I would have had a good chance of topping the route. When you hesitate it never ends well.”\n\nAlso on hold 38+ was Japan’s Omata Shion who finished fifth. Omata’s final appearance continued the run of 16 World Cup’s with a men’s Japanese climber in the final.\n\nCzechia’s Adam Ondra made hold 37+ for sixth place, Switzerland’s Sascha Lehmann was seventh on hold 36+ and Spain’s Guillermo Peinado Franganillo posted a personal best performance by making his first final and finishing eighth overall – his previous best was 22nd place.\n\nThe full men’s results can be found here\n\nThe climbing continues with the Speed qualification and Speed finals live from the IFSC World Cup Chamonix 2024 and can be watched live on the IFSC YouTube channel or selected broadcasters depending on where you are viewing from.\n\nNews and updates about the event will be available on the IFSC website and on the Federation’s digital channels: Facebook, Instagram, X, TikTok, LinkedIn, and exclusively for the Chinese audience, Douyin and Weibo.\n\n@2025 ifsc-climbing.org All Rights Reserved"

Here’s how it works.\n\n\nTadej Pogačar has been performing miracles so often as to make them seem mundane. By this point in his career, he has exhausted as many superlatives as he has rivals. But amid his astonishing repertoire, his display at Plateau de Beille on stage 15 will ultimately stand out as a defining work.\n\nFor most of his career, Pogačar has been compelled to participate in two races at once, one on the road against his current rivals and the other in the imagination against the giants of eras past. Such is the burden of the man who has been touted as the new Eddy Merckx for the bones of the past four years.\n\nOn Sunday, Pogačar outpaced his contemporary rival Jonas Vingegaard by 1:08 to push his overall Tour de France lead beyond three minutes. In the race against posterity, meanwhile, he beat the late Marco Pantani’s 1998 record at Plateau de Beille by a startling 3:40.\n\nIt had long been believed that the records from that era of excess were all but unbeatable, though that certainty has been fraying during cycling’s supersonic 2020s. Even so, nobody could have anticipated that Pogačar would sail past it as casually as this, providing something like cycling’s equivalent of Bob Beamon’s jaw-dropping leap into history at the Mexico Olympics.\n\n“I don’t know how Pantani rode back in the day, that’s almost now 30 years ago,” Pogačar said in the press conference truck afterwards. “But today Visma set a super, super strong pace from the beginning and then Jonas did most of the work until my attack. Then I pushed my limit. I’m just super happy to take the win and I’m not thinking about the Strava segment.”\n\nNever mind Strava, Pogačar is racing against history. No rider has won the Giro-Tour double since Pantani in 1998, but the Slovenian has moved considerably closer to that feat after his crushing display here.\n\nWhen Pogačar won more or as less as he pleased in Italy in May, racking up six stage wins and claiming Giro d'Italia victory by almost ten minutes, the caveat was that he was lacking competitors of his exalted level. The same cannot be said of this Tour, where he is racing against the deepest field of the season and, of course, against Vingegaard, the man with whom he has duelled so closely these past three Julys.\n\nThe latest race content, interviews, features, reviews and expert buying guides, direct to your inbox!\n\nPogačar had already put 40 seconds into Vingegaard with his late attack at Pla d’Adet on Saturday, but the Dane was bullish afterwards about his prospects of returning the blow with interest on stage 15, on a day that seemed likely to reward endurance as well as explosiveness.\n\nVisma-Lease a Bike duly took up the reins of pace-making in the yellow jersey group in the finale, with Matteo Jorgenson setting a fierce tempo after the race swung through Tarascon-sur-Ariège and began the 16km haul to the line.\n\nVingegaard’s inevitable attack came with 10.5km to go, and Pogačar was immediately on his wheel. He stayed locked there for the next 5km, assessing his rival’s pedalling from close range. When Vingegaard cast a weary glance over his shoulder with 5.5km remaining, Pogačar understood the moment had come. Match point. He climbed from the saddle and accelerated past the Dane.\n\n“He set a super good pace, but when he finally attacked again – the final attack from him, just before my attack – I saw that maybe I could do some difference from him if I tried,” Pogačar said. “It was really hard to break him and to make the bigger gap. I was going all-out to the finish line.”\n\nAt first, as per the usual pattern of their duel, Vingegaard managed to hold Pogačar’s advantage at 20 metres or so, but the gap steadily yawned outwards thereafter, with the yellow jersey essentially gaining 10 seconds per kilometre on the upper portion of the climb. Vingegaard, like Remco Evenepoel – third on the day at 2:51 – also finished inside Pantani’s old record on the climb. The trouble was that Pogačar had raised the bar to heights never seen before.\n\n“I was going all-out to the finish line,” Pogačar said. “I was all the time hearing he was at 35 seconds, 35 seconds. I thought he was maybe recovering and coming back, but in the end, I think I cracked him and I’m super happy to have this gap.\n\n“I could not imagine for a better weekend. Today I was counting down the final kilometres, the final minutes because it was so hard. But it was worth it in the end, I was super happy.”\n\nIn the overall standings, Pogačar now leads Vingegaard by 3:09 and Evenepoel by 5:19, while everybody else is more than ten minutes down. At this remove, the yellow jersey’s surprising struggles on the Col de Pertus on stage 11 look like a blip rather than a turning point. For all Vingegaard’s aptitude for the rigours of the third week, it seems increasingly difficult to imagine anything other than a Pogačar victory in Nice next Sunday.\n\n“The Tour finishes when you arrive normally on Champs-Élysées but this year it’s Nice,” Pogačar smiled. “When we arrive on the main street of Nice, then it’s finished. We can speak about the finish then, not before. We will stay focused until that moment.”\n\nEscapee Tobias Halland Johannessen (Uno X-Mobility) spoke for many when he described the feeling of being caught and passed by Pogačar and Vingegaard on Plateau de Beille: “It’s like I don’t do the same sport.” Not for the first time, Pogačar made it all look so disarmingly easy here.\n\n“I also breathe and suffer,” he said. “But it’s just the way it is. Some people suffer more, some people suffer less. It’s how it is. It’s a bike race, no?”\n\nGet unlimited access to all of our coverage of the Tour de France - including breaking news and analysis reported by our journalists on the ground from every stage of the race as it happens and more. Find out more.\n\nBarry Ryan was Head of Features at Cyclingnews.

(Photo by Brian Rothmuller/Icon Sportswire)\n\nDetails continue to trickle out about the NBA’s recently finalized media rights deals with Disney, Comcast, and Amazon.\n\nThe NBA reportedly finalized its new set of media rights deals last week, with Disney (ESPN/ABC) maintaining the lead package that includes the NBA Finals every year, while newcomers Comcast (NBC/Peacock) and Amazon each secured packages of their own that include regular season and playoff inventory. Warner Bros Discovery (TNT) will seek to exercise its matching rights as an incumbent partner over the coming days, though those efforts are unlikely to produce results.\n\nSince the original reports, new details have emerged about how each network’s inventory will be divvied up. As was originally reported, Comcast and Amazon will alternate years in which they broadcast a conference final, with ESPN airing the other conference final. However, that arrangement will be slightly different during one year of the NBA’s new 11-year agreements, per Andrew Marchand of The Athletic. \n\nComcast and Amazon’s agreements with the league grant them rights to six conference finals each, meaning there will be one year in which ESPN does not broadcast a conference final over the term of the new deals. It is not clear which year that will be, though it will make for an interesting dynamic where ESPN has a substantial gap in its NBA playoff coverage between the second round and the Finals. During the other ten years of the new deals, ESPN will share the conference finals with either NBC or Amazon.\n\nIn other NBA media rights news, NBC will broadcast the NBA All-Star Game and NBA All-Star Saturday Night (which includes the dunk contest and three-point contest) each year under the new deals, per Alex Sherman of CNBC. ESPN will continue to air the Celebrity All-Star Game on Friday night.\n\nTNT has aired 22 consecutive All-Star Games dating back to 2003 — the first time the game aired on cable. Should the network fall short in its matching efforts, the 2026 All-Star Game will be the first to air on broadcast television since NBC’s telecast of the 2002 All-Star Game.\n\nOf course, with TNT at risk of losing its NBA rights, the future of Inside the NBA remains in flux. Speaking with CNBC on Thursday, Charles Barkley reiterated his position that he would not work for any other network aside from TNT. Barkley said, while he hopes TNT will “get a last minute reprieve” that allows the network to keep some NBA rights, he “wouldn’t feel comfortable going to work for another network” after 25 years with TNT.\n\nPending the status of TNT’s matching efforts, the NBA could announce its new deals in the coming weeks prior to the Olympics which begin July 26.\n\n(Marchand, 7.12) (Sherman, 7.12) (CNBC, 7.11)\n\n\n\t\t\t\tDrew Lerner is a broadcast production professional based in Washington D.C. When he's not watching sports on television, you can find him hacking it around on the golf course.

I don’t have Amazon Prime and I think you might need Amazon Prime to watch. I haven’t looked into it yet.\n\nIt’s not over yet, TNT you have the money, come on, keep NBC away from the NBA at all costs. We already have a broadcast network in ABC we don’t need another. Plus I have always loved Inside the NBA.\n\nTo be honest I rather have TNT than Amazon vs TNT instead of NBC, due to the fact that NBC’s package is going to be on Peacock heavy already, and with a Amazon package it’s just going to be streaming heavy, I rather have a bit more broadcast than ABC, but I do want some cable and not a bunch of streaming exclusives\n\nYou’ve always loved Inside the NBA. Well guess what? I want NBC to return because I’ve always loved Roundball Rock. You see the way this works? Everybody has something they like depending what generation you’re from. I personally get more interested in the game with a great opening production than listening to four blowhards spending most of their time not even concentrating on the game. At the end of the day, NBC would provide better all-around coverage of the league and give it more exposure. There is definitely a need for multiple broadcast networks because at this rate, who’s to say TNT will even still exist by 2036 the way cable is going down the drain. That’s not the case with ABC/NBC.\n\nWill every conference finals game NBC has be on NBC or will some games go to USA or even Peacock?\n\nGood question. I haven’t heard anything on the USA Network front at all.\n\nCould the NBA programming moving to NBC and USA Network on Tuesday nights be related to WWE NXT moving to CW and Raw moving to Netflix? Additionally, NBC’s primetime 8- 11 pm shows could affect programming decisions from the East Coast to the West Coast in the upcoming 2025-2026 season. What impact will this have on Spanish-language views on Telemundo and Universo which owns NBC company?\n\nThe NBC Tuesday night games suggest to me that the network will no longer have scripted or reality programming on those nights.\n\nI think it will still have some programming on Tuesdays for NBC, since USA makes more sense for Tuesdays than NBC, but the Sunday night games are locked in for NBC almost 100% on that even if NBC gets the Tuesday games it will still have scripted and reality programming in the fall and summer months\n\nI think the only time you’ll see the USA Network televising ANY NBA games in this soon to be setup would be in conflict situations; e.g. a start of a playoff game being overlapped by the end of another one. Some breaking news story, etc.\n\nWhat about the conflict between the Winter Olympics and the Super Bowl on NBC Sports in 2026, during the NBA All-Star weekend? How will this impact the NBA’s tight schedule when it conflicts with NBC’s programming in February 2026?\n\nI would assume ABC and other networks could cover during this period, and NBC airs the all star game after the Olympic games\n\nBring back the NBA All-Star Game on NBC.\n\nThis is very interesting details, but will NBC also get the rising stars game when this new deal kicks off? (Since that is currently on TNT as well), but how the conference finals rotation will go will be interesting, but I hope the ESPN not airing the conference finals either happens the first year (to get the new broadcasters a fresh start) or the last (to cap it off) but I hope NBC gets to air 1 of their conference finals first before Amazon goes the next year (since NBC can generate higher ratings), but is it the whole conference finals that will air on broadcast television though or will some of it be on cable/streaming? (Similar to ESPN/ABC, but hopefully more than 2 games this time though)\n\nHave to imagine Rising Stars would air on Peacock.\n\nDo we think Amazon can produce pull for the NBA? NBC is an obvious hit but the NBA isn’t the NFL, I don’t know if they can get 5+ million to get on a streaming service for the conference finals, let alone 1+ million for normal RS games\n\nI would imagine that all the Conference Finals games NBC would have will all be on NBC and simulcast on Peacock and be treated as if it were the NBA Finals since it will be the last playoff series for the network for that particular season. Plus putting the ASG back on NBC and All Star Saturday Night on NBC is a great idea to get the maximum viewership and promotion.\n\nJon,\nNot nba related, but can you do a quick ratings prediction for today’s 2 soccer games on Fox?\n\nI’ll say FOX gets 7.5ish million for the Euro final — up from ’21 — and 4.2 million for the Copa final. Add in 4.8ish million on Univision for a combined 9M.\n\n*2026 all-star game, sixth paragraph\n\n\nAbout  •  Contact •  Report an Error • Privacy \n\n© 2025 Jon Lewis, Sports Media Watch\n\n© 2025 Sports Media Watch"

        "expanded content": "Inspired by her compatriot’s love of and success at SW19, the Czech has ticked off another item on her bucket list\n\nAt the age of 12, Barbora Krejcikova wrote in a notebook three things she wanted to achieve in the future, if she was fortunate enough to make it as a professional tennis player. At that stage, she had no idea if she would be able to make a living from the sport but she was dreaming big.\n\n“I think I wrote there that I wanted to be a top 10 tennis player,” the Czech said on Saturday evening, a few hours after becoming Wimbledon champion for the first time with a thrilling win against Italy’s Jasmine Paolini.\n\n“I think I wrote there that I would like to win Roland Garros and I think I wrote there that I would like to represent Czech Republic during the Olympics and get the medal.”\n\nTick, tick, tick. Krejcikova had already achieved all three things before coming to Wimbledon. She has been ranked as high as No 2, won the French Open in 2021 and won the doubles gold medal at the Tokyo Olympics with Katerina Siniakova.\n\nWinning Wimbledon was not something she had considered at that stage and it was only after she met Jana Novotna, her compatriot and winner here in 1998, that triumphing on the grass entered her mind.\n\n“Maybe things shifted a little bit when I actually met Jana and when she was telling me all the stories about Wimbledon, about the grass, how difficult it was for her to win the title and how emotional she was when she actually made it,” the Czech said. “I think since then I started to see Wimbledon as the biggest tournament in the world.”\n\nIt was when she was 14 that Krejcikova put a letter through the door of Novotna, who lived in the same town as her, Brno, and her life changed. Krejcikova can’t remember the exact words she used but she asked Novotna if she would be able to help her fulfil her dreams, to put her on the right track. Novotna accepted and coached Krejcikova from 2014 until her death from cancer in 2017.\n\nKrejcikova has now won 12 grand slam titles in all: two in singles, seven in women’s doubles and three in mixed. Watching her hold her poise in the final, it’s strange to think that until 2020, she was primarily considered a doubles player. “I was playing very well in doubles but in singles I was just outside of the top 100,” said the 28-year-old, who will return to the top 10 on Monday.\n\n“I tried to combine the singles and doubles career but it was difficult. Things kind of clicked after Covid, during 2020 and I finally got into the top 100. From that I was able to get some good results also in singles.”\n\nIf her French Open title in 2021 was unexpected, due to her relatively low ranking, so was this one, thanks to a first half of the year interrupted by injury and illness. After a promising start, when she reached the quarter-finals at the Australian Open, she picked up a bacterial virus in Miami, got Covid in Madrid and lost all four of her matches on clay, including a first-round exit at Roland Garros.\n\nSign up to The Recap\n\nThe best of our sports journalism from the past seven days and a heads-up on the weekend’s action\n\nafter newsletter promotion\n\n“It wasn’t really a good journey coming to Wimbledon,” she said. “I didn’t have to spend time in hospital but I had 10 days of antibiotics, which is not really good for the body and for the system. And then with Covid I was isolating myself and I had [a temperature of] 39 degrees for five days, so it was quite severe. It was a very tough, tough, tough period.”\n\nHer success at Wimbledon is all the more impressive for that. Keeping herself calm between matches by doing Lego – she would like to see a Wimbledon Centre Court option come on the market– Krejcikova came through tough early matches before hitting her stride. As pure a ball-striker as anyone, she always had the game to succeed on any surface and is one of only two active women, together with Simona Halep, to have won both Roland Garros and Wimbledon.\n\nLaid-back and not one for big celebrations, she doesn’t know what to expect when she returns to the Czech Republic but is excited to play in Prague later this month. From there, she will head to Paris for the Olympics where she will be aiming for a first singles gold and be reunited with Siniakova in doubles, the pair having split at the end of 2023.\n\n“I love to represent my country,” she said. “I experienced the Tokyo Olympics. It was something unbelievable. I really enjoyed the atmosphere at Czech House and also meeting other athletes from different countries. It was very, very nice, different than the regular tennis tournaments. I’m really looking forward to that.”"

But just more so you want to [see] positivity and hope. It sounds cheesy, but it’s real. That’s when our country’s at its best, and it just adds another blemish to what’s going on. So sad is just the word.”\n\nThe team will stay in the Middle East this week before playing preparation games against Australia on Monday and then Serbia on Wednesday.\n\nThe opening ceremony in Paris is set for Friday, July 26 and the U.S. men’s first game is on July 28 against Serbia.\n\n“Obviously what we’re doing is very trivial, just playing basketball, but we want to put our best selves out there to try to give people a glimpse of what our country can be about,” Kerr said. “And then you hear something like this and it’s just so demoralizing and obviously so sad.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement"

It was declared a ‘B’ international fixture, which meant it would not count towards any official statistics, including caps and goals, or FIFA ranking points. And for a team like the Matildas, who always seem to do their best work when stakes are at their highest, you could tell it wasn’t a full-bore effort.\n\nGustavsson had warned they would look tired because of their intense training schedule, and so it proved. He said that was by design.\n\n“We wanted to prepare to play with heavy legs, where it’s difficult to focus, you might not have the power in your runs,” Gustavsson said. “We’re always an aggressive team that plays with high-octane energy. But in an Olympic tournament, when there’s such a tight turnaround of games, you know you’re going to have to play with fatigue at times.”\n\nCanada’s 2-1 win was a tough watch, and not only because of the result. At times, it resembled a training run, because it was. Both teams approached it with specific aims to round out their Olympic preparations; for the Matildas, it was about testing different formations, combinations and tactics, seeing how they’d cope with Canada’s high press, as well as getting a precise number of minutes into each player as dictated by their medical staff.\n\nThe aim is to have them peaking on July 25, when they face Germany in their Paris 2024 opener - not now, when it doesn’t really matter.\n\nIndeed, this match was totally meaningless, in a sense. But try telling that to Sharn Freier, who made her first start in Australian colours as Foord’s late replacement. Freier is one of the four ‘alternates’ who the Matildas will bring to Paris, all of whom have high hopes of actual involvement due to a last-minute regulation change which allows teams to swap injured players in and out of their squads of 18, effectively making them squads of 22.\n\nGustavsson described this as Freier’s “breakthrough game”, and though her first-half goal can’t be regarded as her first senior goal for the Matildas, she won’t care. She showed some great touches across the 90 minutes and played well off Cortnee Vine and Mary Fowler, who provided the assist for her 24th-minute strike, which put Australia in front.\n\nThat lead was extinguished four minutes before half-time when Mackenzie Arnold made an uncharacteristic howler, failing to secure a routine cross which was promptly poked home by Nichelle Prince. Arnold immediately apologised to her teammates; if there’s a good time to make errors like that, it’s before the Olympics, not during them.\n\nCanada were clearly the better team and secured a deserved victory when Evelyne Vines fired through heavy traffic in the box and past Arnold in the 85th minute. They finished with 19 shots on goal, but only six were on target, and one was a gift from Arnold, so the Matildas will be broadly pleased with their defensive efforts in stifling the attack of the reigning Olympic champions.\n\nThe big concern was in the other direction.\n\nAustralia finished with only two shots for the match, with Freier’s goal the only one on target. Despite having fractionally more of the ball, their inability to generate chances was a worry.\n\n“We normally create a lot of chances when we play, and I don’t think we did that tonight,” Gustavsson said. “We had some really good build up sequences ... but then that action of breaking that last line, we’re normally better at that.”\n\nThe positives? Aside from Freier, the other standout was Clare Wheeler, who filled in at left-back in the first half and reverted to her preferred midfield spot in the second. At no stage in either position was she exposed, and her continued development takes some of the pressure off Katrina Gorry, who got 45 minutes under her belt in her first match since injuring her ankle while playing for West Ham in April. Winonah Heatley also came on in the second half for her first taste of international football, albeit with all the aforementioned asterisks attached to it; she is not even one of the ‘alternates’ for Paris, and was drafted into camp to help with numbers at training.\n\nBut it is hard to escape the sense that the Matildas are a long way from where they’d prefer to be, less than a fortnight out from crunch time. Foord’s quad complaint is a fresh headache that Gustavsson could do without. Still, the hope is she, Catley, Torpey and Yallop will all be passed fit to face Germany.\n\n“You always want to have all your players fit, in form and flying,” Gustavsson said. “I’ve also been around long enough to know that the only thing we can focus on what we can control.”\n\nAnd that’s it.\n\nThe reigning Olympic champions take the win, with a 2-1 victory over the Matildas.\n\nSharn Freier was not meant to start, but Caitlin Foord’s late withdrawal opened the door for her - and she took her opportunity with a tidy first-half goal. Unfortunately, that was one of few fluent attacks by Australia in Marbella this morning.\n\nA horror moment from Mackenzie Arnold allowed Nichelle Prince to strike four minutes before half-time to make it 1-1. And then, with five minutes of regulation time left, Evelyne Viens pulled the trigger in heavy traffic to give Canada the lead.\n\nA deserved victory for Canada, who look primed and ready for the Olympics - unlike the Matildas, who have a number of fitness concerns and looked heavy-legged in this clash, although coach Tony Gustavsson forecast that that would be the case due to their intense training load. \n\nWhat does it mean for their Paris campaign? It’s too early to say.\n\nAnd there it is, the pay-off for all of Canada’s dominance in this second half. They’ve gone 2-1 up in the 85th minute through Evelyne Viens, and the goal comes after waves of sustained pressure which eventually the Matildas’ defence buckled beneath.\n\nIt was on Charli Grant’s side where they were able to make the incision and the move ended with Viens firing past Mackenzie Arnold from close range.\n\nLooks like the Matildas are going to lose this one, unless they can find an equaliser at the end of a half where they’ve barely had any chances in attack.\n\n...and it’s another ‘phantom debut’, if you want to call it that.\n\nWinonah Heatley has come on for Clare Hunt, marking her first appearance in Australian colours - but, again, not her maiden Matildas cap, because this is not an A international fixture. Still, a moment to remember.\n\nHunt didn’t put a foot wrong, by the way. Has she put a foot wrong since she came into the Matildas set-up? Not that I can recall.\n\nJust over 10 minutes left in this contest, it’s still 1-1.\n\nThis is an important opportunity for all the players in the Australian squad but particularly those outside of it, after the rule change which enables teams at the Olympics to essentially swap any of their 18 players for the four alternates at any time.\n\nTwo of those alternates, Sharn Freier and Charli Grant, have been decent. Freier obviously scored Australia’s goal but Grant is playing at right-back and has done well to quell any Canadian activity down that flank.\n\nWith Caitlin Foord and Steph Catley under injury clouds, they could very well find themselves in action against Germany in 12 days’ time.\n\nClare Wheeler has also looked very sturdy since returning to midfield from left-back, where she filled in during the first half - not that she was bad there either.\n\nAnyway - we’re into the 73rd minute now and it’s still 1-1.\n\nAs always when heaps of substitutions are made, the game becomes a little bit disjointed and unsettled. But within that, the Matildas have looked OK in the first 10 minutes of this second half - and they’ve just denied Canada’s best chance so far, with Clare Polkinghorne getting in position to block an effort by Jordyn Huitema.\n\n...and it looks like there have been five changes made by Tony Gustavsson.\n\nMichelle Heyman, Charli Grant, Clare Polkinghorne, Emily van Egmond and Courney Nevin are on - Ellie Carpenter, Alanna Kennedy, Katrina Gorry, Hayley Raso and Cortnee Vine have come off.\n\nThe first half is done. Sharn Freier’s tidy strike was cancelled out by Nichelle Prince, who pounced upon a rare howler by Mackenzie Arnold, and so it’s 1-1 at the break. \n\nHard to know what to make of that from a Matildas perspective. It wasn’t exactly the most fluent performance, and I was preparing to give them a pat on the back for their defensive solidity until they conceded that goal. Before that, they’d done fairly well to repel Canada’s attacks.\n\nBy and large, they’ve done OK. This is the wrong game to make too many judgments, since it’s clear the players aren’t going full bore.\n\nExpect to see a lot of substitutions in the second half.\n\n1 of 3\n\nCopyright © 2025"

After qualification was postponed due to storms on Friday, Saturday entertained the crowds with Speed qualification, finals after Lead qualification earlier in the day.\n\nIn the women’s Speed, China’s Zhang Shaoqin won her first IFSC World Cup gold medal after making her way through the finals rounds to set up a finale against Poland’s Natalia Kalucka.\n\nIn the final match-up, Kalucka fell to hand her rival the gold and herself having to settle for silver. Zhang posted a 6.60 in the big final and said: \"First of all, I’m so happy. I broke my personal best. I really like this place, it’s my happy place.\"\n\nSilver medallist Kalucka said: \"I’m happy because it’s my first medal in Chamonix and I am proud of myself. Not getting that Olympic ticket means now I don’t really have my goals set so I will go to Briançon as I don’t have many competitions left this year. I’ll be in Paris though to support my sister and do some work with the Polish Federation.\"\n\nSouth Korea’s Jeong Jimin completed the podium winning the bronze medal, her second podium after also winning bronze in Wujiang at the start of the season.\n\nJeong beat China’s Wang Shengyan in the small final with a time of 6.64 compared to Wang’s 7.33.\n\nFull women’s Speed results here\n\nWorld record holder, USA’s Sam Watson won gold in Chamonix, giving him his third gold of his career.\n\nWatson had a consistent run during the finals rounds and posted three times under 5-seconds in the competition - 4.83, 4.84, 4.88.\n\nThe American climber beat China’s Wang Xinshang, who had to settle for the silver medal with both slipping in the final and posting times of 6.24 for Watson and 7.76 for Wang.\n\nTalking about his consistency Watson said: \"I’ve been working on my consistency with a boring two months training, well boring is not the right word, but tedious training cycle where I tried to work hard every day and I was looking forward to this trip so much. Having consistent 4.8’s and near the world record is a dream for sure and shows I am in the right place.\"\n\nWhen talking about his win, Watson continued: \"I feel great. I kind of had a Chamonix curse where I didn’t do well for the past two years, my worst comp of the year, but then to come back in my last event before the Olympics and get a win, my third win, in front of all these people that came out was just one of the best experiences as a climber.”\n\nThird place and the bronze medal went to Spain’s Erik Noya Cardona who took advantage of a slip and fall from Japan’s Omasa Ryo in the bronze medal match.\n\nPosting a 5.05 in that match up, Noya Cardona said: \"It’s my second medal in Chamonix. This place has a lot of meaning for me, this is the competition I like the most. After I didn’t qualify for the Olympics it was hard for me so being back on the podium, trusting myself, gaining some confidence, breaking my record, it was huge for me. It was something unexpected but something I really needed. It is really a push for me, for Spain, and I am really happy about this and I will go and party a bit today – I think I deserve it.\"\n\nOmasa had earlier set a PB and Japanese National record with 4.97, and there were other records that fell in the qualifications round.\n\nItaly’s Matteo Zurloni set the European record with 4.97, New Zealand’s Julian David set the Oceania record with 5.44 and South Africa’s Joshua Bruyns set the African record with 5.73.\n\nFull men’s Speed results here\n\nNews and updates about the event will be available on the IFSC website and on the Federation’s digital channels: Facebook, Instagram, X, TikTok, LinkedIn, and exclusively for the Chinese audience, Douyin and Weibo.\n\n@2025 ifsc-climbing.org All Rights Reserved"

Brown isn't a Nike-sponsored athlete, and the 27-year-old has been heavily critical of the billion-dollar corporation's ethics in the past. \n\nHowever, another window of opportunity might open for Brown -- yet again.\n\n\"If things change and it becomes clear that (Kevin) Durant can't play at the Olympics, Brown's name could resurface as a replacement,\" according to Joe Vardon of The Athletic.\n\nStory continues below advertisement\n\nDurant is healing from a calf injury, which Team USA head coach Steve Kerr revealed makes the 35-year-old unlikely to play in Monday's Olympic exhibition matchup against Australia. The severity of the injury is unclear. \n\nJrue Holiday, one of three Celtics teammates chosen ahead of Brown, was the only prior exception -- aside from White -- of Team USA's brass favoring role players over stars. In fact, White is the only roster member without multiple All-Star appearances to his name. Traditionally, USA Basketball has almost always leaned on the NBA's star power when assembling its Olympic crew, and this predominately remained the case in 2024, too. \n\nLeBron James, Stephen Curry, Joel Embiid, Anthony Edwards, Jayson Tatum and Devin Booker don't exactly fit the \"role-player\" mold. \n\n\"You have to build a team. And one of the hardest things is leaving people off the roster that I'm a fan of, that I look forward to watching throughout the season, throughout the playoffs,\" USA men's national team managing director Grant Hill told reporters Wednesday, per Chris Forsberg of NBC Sports Boston. \"Guys who've been Finals MVP, guys who have been a part of the program, guys who've won gold medals. Guys who I respect, admire and enjoy watching. But the responsibility that I have is to put together a team and a team that complements each other.\"\n\nStory continues below advertisement\n\nBrown, who last season averaged 23 points on 49.9% shooting from the floor, didn't provide much of a response when attending Thursday night's ESPY Awards in Los Angeles, but does remain adamant on an uncovered factor working behind the scenes.\n\n\"It feels great to have support, and one day I'll share my story,\" Brown told Sports Illustrated. \"People don't have all the information in the world that they'd like to know. It just feels great to be here at the ESPYs and to be holding up the Larry O'Brien.\"\n\nTeam USA still has four showcase contests, including Monday's against Australia, before heading to Paris to open up the Olympic group play of games against Serbia on July 28.\n\nDigital Content Producer\n\nBetter known as \"Writer Gio\" in the comments section.

(Matildas.)\n\nThe Matildas have lost their final warm-up game to defending gold medallists Canada 2-1 just 12 days out from their first Olympic group game against Germany.\n\nA debut goal to Sharn Frier, who was called into the starting side after a last-minute withdrawal of Caitlin Foord from the warm-up, was the brightest spark in an otherwise fatigued performance, with a Mackenzie Arnold error and some sloppy defending handing Canada the win in Spain.\n\nHead coach Tony Gustavsson had flagged earlier in the week that his players would come into this match tired, having pushed them through double sessions during the past ten days of heavy training. \n\nAnd they played as expected, lacking energy and sharpness on the ball in the opening 20 minutes, and regularly losing out to the more physical and hungry Canadians. Striker Adrianna Leon and winger Cloe Lacasse were particularly dangerous, finding space in behind Australia's back-line and rocketing off a few crosses and shots that had to be saved by Arnold.\n\nGustavsson was forced to adjust his starting line-up after injuries to captain Steph Catley and Kaitlyn Torpey kept them sidelined, with Cortnee Vine and Clare Wheeler coming into the side alongside the debutant Frier, while Katrina Gorry got her first minutes for Australia after a few months recovering from ankle surgery.\n\nWheeler was a particular stand-out, proving her versatility at left-back in the absence of Catley before slotting into midfield in place of Gorry in the second half, and rarely put a foot wrong in either position.\n\nHowever, both Vine and Frier struggled to create opportunities going forward, with the Matildas regularly losing the ball after being suffocated by Canada's high-energy press.\n\nThe few half-chances that did fall their way came on the counter-attack, capitalising on a Canada error before bursting forward at speed. Vine in particular had a few runs in behind Canada's defence down the right, pulling apart their deeper players to create space in behind.\n\nIt was this space that Mary Fowler exploited in the 23rd minute when she pounced on a loose ball and took off towards the top of the box before squaring for Frier, who turned her defender neatly before shooting low and hard into the far corner of the net for her first Australian goal.\n\nConscious of player loads and preparing their bodies for the gruelling tournament ahead, Gustavsson made several substitutions over the course of the match, trying and testing several players and tactical structures that the team needed to rehearse.\n\nDue to the game's status as an international 'B' fixture, both sides had unlimited substitutions and many more windows in which to make them, allowing Gustavsson to empty his entire 18-player bench, including a first senior appearance for young centre-back Winonah Heatley, who was called into camp late as an injury back-up, though is not part of the 22-player Matildas squad for Paris.\n\nWith the camera regularly zooming in on the Australian bench in lieu of a crowd, multiple players including Foord, Kennedy, and Gorry could be seen with ice packs around various body parts, though Gustavsson said most player situations are precautionary, with the aim for everybody to be fit and firing for the opening group match against Germany, not today's friendly against Canada.\n\n\"First of all, I think it's important that we put everything in perspective,\" he said afterwards.\n\n\"We have planned for a very long time what we want to do in this camp to make sure that we peak physically and mentally against Germany: it's all about that opening game.\n\n\"We have also trained very hard so we came into this game fatigued, and I appreciate the [cooperation] from Canada around subs and such so that we could use this game in a little bit of a different way than we normally do in a FIFA window.\n\n\"We wanted to prepare to play with heavy legs, where it's difficult to focus, you might not have the power in your lungs. \n\n\"We're always an aggressive team that plays with lots of energy, but in an Olympic tournament with such a tight turn-around between games, you know you're gonna have to play with fatigue at times, and learning to play with fatigue was also part of this game.\n\n\"Finally, when it comes to the performances of individual players, we wanted to test players who needed minutes, because we [may] need them all come Olympics, and the final thing is to protect some players that we have.\"\n\nHaving muscled their way back into the game towards the end of the first half, a horror Mackenzie Arnold error then handed Canada an equaliser, spilling a regulation catch into the feet of Nichelle Prince, who tapped home.\n\nThe Matildas could have scored again after a storming run by Wheeler saw her receive the ball in acres of space in Canada's penalty area, but her attempted square pass trickled past all her team-mates and went out for a goal-kick instead.\n\nA rare Mackenzie Arnold error gifted Canada an equaliser. (AAP: Darren England)\n\nGustavsson made five changes at half-time, taking off captain Ellie Carpenter, Gorry, Vine, Kennedy, and Raso, and bringing on Charli Grant, Emily Van Egmond, Michelle Heyman, Clare Polkinghorne, and Courtney Nevin for the second stanza.\n\nCanada used the opportunity of multiple substitution windows to throw on several fresh legs, too, and head coach Bev Priestman's rotation ultimately paid off as two substitutes Jordyn Huitema and Evelyn Viens combined, pouncing on some sloppy Matildas defending in the box to slam home the winner.\n\nAustralia take on Germany on July 26 at 3:00am AEST, with all the action from their Olympic campaign captured live and free on the ABC Sport liveblogs.\n\nCheck out how this morning's game unfolded below.\n\nBy Samantha Lewis\n\nSHARN FRIER GETS HER FIRST GOAL FOR AUSTRALIA!\n\nIt was totally against the run of play, too. Mary Fowler pounced on some sloppy Canada possession and charged towards the top of the box before squaring left for Frier.\n\nThe Brisbane Roar winger stood up to Ashley Lawrence, feinting one way and then another, putting the ball on her left boot and hammering it low and hard across goal and into the net.\n\n1-0!\n\nBy Samantha Lewis\n\nThanks for joining me on the blog this morning!\n\nI'll have a match report up shortly, but it's important to note that this result isn't as disastrous as it may seem from the headlines. Remember: the Matildas are practising a bunch of things we don't know about, and winning this game wasn't their priority.\n\nParis is. And speaking of the Olympics, I'll be back here to blog every Matildas game across the Games, starting with the first group-stage match against Germany on July 26 from 2:30am AEST.\n\nSo get your coffee pots ready, fam. It's gonna be a sleep-deprived few weeks.\n\nBy Samantha Lewis\n\nThe Matildas looked somewhat listless during the match and were lucky to have Sharn Freier score in the first half, hopefully we can step up for the game against Germany when our Olympic campaign gets underway and injuries to key players aren't that serious.\n\n- Adam\n\nGreat game from Frier so far. Should boost her confidence. ⚽️💚💛\n\n- Leo\n\nBy Samantha Lewis\n\nI hope this is just me being paranoid but this game doesn’t make me feel too good about the olympics.\n\n- M\n\nYeah, look, there was light and shade to this game.\n\nWe saw what Australia looked like while under pressure from a very well-drilled, physical, and confident side. Last-minute changes to the team due to niggles certainly threw a spanner in things, but I think they did okay in the circumstances.\n\nThey lacked energy and sharpness, yes, but that was the plan from the start: have the players already feeling the physical toll of a heavy load and get them to perform. They don't want to be peaking in a friendly against Canada, they want to be peaking at the Olympics.\n\nSharn Frier got her first goal for Australia, finishing off one of the team's few counter-attacking chances, but there are certainly some questions around what their attack looks like without Caitlin Foord and Hayley Raso carrying the team forward down either flank.\n\nWhat did you make of the performance, gang?\n\nBy Samantha Lewis\n\nBy Samantha Lewis\n\nThe midfielder picks up the ball near the top of the box and decides to simply try and break through this red wall of Canadian defenders herself, slaloming into the area with the ball on her toe past one, two, three players angling towards the by-line on the left side.\n\nShe opens her body up and tries to shoot, but a red shirt crashes into her from the side, forcing her shot out for a goal-kick.\n\nTony Gustavsson is screaming from the sideline - probably asking for the penalty - but the referee waves the moment away.\n\nBy Samantha Lewis\n\nAustralia are still pushing after that second Canada goal, but they haven't looked likely to score all half and they're probably not gonna do it in these dying minutes.\n\nThey're moving the ball nicely, though, and have finally regained some territory after that period of Canada dominance that led up to the goal a few minutes ago.\n\nArnold pings a delightful long pass right into Mary Fowler's path, who takes a glorious touch before threading through Van Egmond.\n\nShe had a chance to shoot, but she turns and keeps the ball instead, passing back to Nevin who crosses into the box.\n\nThere's a bit of a scramble among players, but the ball is eventually cleared away.\n\nBy Samantha Lewis\n\nIs Macca wearing number 1 now that Lydia has retired from International team or still number 18?\n\n- Meagan\n\nCorrect, Meagan!\n\nAfter Lydia Williams' retirement last month, she handed over the number 1 jersey to Mackenzie Arnold.\n\nBy Samantha Lewis\n\nSubstitute Evelyn Viens makes it 2 for Canada!\n\nAustralia's defence had been under pressure for the past few minutes, and Charli Grant is the one who loses the ball as she tries to progress out of the box on the far side.\n\nPolkinghorne comes flying across to try and block the assumed shot, but Huitema cuts back for Viens, who's got plenty of space near the penalty spot, and slams it into the far corner.\n\n2-1.\n\nBy Samantha Lewis\n\nAnd just as I say that, Winonah Heatley loses the ball while trying to pass out from the back as Jordyn Huitema takes off in behind, with just Clare Polkinghorne - who's stationed a good couple of metres away - the only defender in front of her.\n\nThe striker takes a look up and sees Mackenzie Arnold off her line, so decides to go for a long shot.\n\nArnold dives to her right but the ball zips past her... and rolls just wide of the far post for a goal-kick.\n\nThat was so close!\n\nBy Samantha Lewis\n\nJanine Beckie just picked the pocket of Courtney Nevin as she tried to turn out and carry the ball from the back, but the ref blows the whistle as the Canada substitute clipped the full-back in the process.\n\nBoth teams have settled down a bit more in the past five minutes. Neither are really pushing to score a second goal; they both seem to be focusing on their structures and staying disciplined (and, most of all, avoiding injuries!)\n\nBy Samantha Lewis\n\nWinonah Heatley, who was called into camp late, gets her debut for Australia in place of Clare Hunt!\n\nFor Canada, Jade Rose is off for Gabrielle Carle.\n\nJayde Riviere is off for Deanne Rose.\n\nAnd Shelina Zadorsky comes on for Kadeisha Buchanan.\n\nBy Samantha Lewis\n\nThey've had the upper-hand since the last drinks break, moving the ball nicely around their back-line and midfield and trying to find openings down either wing.\n\nBut the Matildas are back in numbers, sitting in two deep banks of four and five, with even Michelle Heyman heading away a cross at one point.\n\nShe hasn't done much so far, the striker. She just tore off on a counter-attack and received a pass from Kyra Cooney-Cross, but her pass back infield for Fowler was misdirected and rolled onto the foot of a Canadian instead. That's frustrating.\n\nBy Samantha Lewis\n\nThe second of the night.\n\nStill 1-1 at Marbella Football Centre, with both sides capable of scoring another goal or two, you'd say.\n\nThe broadcast camera has just zoomed in on Katrina Gorry in the stands who's got an ice pack around her ankle - the same one that got surgery only a few months ago.\n\nThat... doesn't make me feel super awesome.\n\nBy Samantha Lewis\n\nThe young winger has had a great time this game: a debut start, a debut goal, and now she's just pulled off a delightful piece of skill, trapping a fizzed pass that sat up in the air before nutmegging her opposing defender Jade Rose with an outside-of-the-foot feint and turn.\n\nShe charged towards the by-line and tried to pull a cross back, but it wasn't angled too well and was easily collected by goalkeeper Kailen Sheridan.\n\nOh well, worth it just to see that.\n\nBy Samantha Lewis\n\nU&aunty R weirdly the beneficiary of ch10 scamming us heheh.. ;) altho tbf I usually check ABC liveblog even when I watch on telly.. <3. \n(esp. since the Twit(er) self-imploded up it's own X)\n\n- $pacK!edH0r$e\n\nSam, your Paramount (sic) concern is to continue giving us great siphon-busting commentary. Keep it up.\n\n- Peter\n\nThanks, I suppose, goes to P+/Network 10 for their weird broadcast arrangement which has ended up funnelling you lost and desperate Tillies fans onto my blog this morning. Hope the big-wigs at the ABC are happy!\n\nBy Samantha Lewis\n\nCloe Lacasse, who's been terrific this morning, is replaced by Evelyn Viens.\n\nAnd captain Jessie Fleming is off for Julia Grosso.\n\nBy Samantha Lewis\n\nThey struggled doing it in the first half, but are looking a bit sharper and more coordinated now as they work the ball out from their back line.\n\nCanada are very well-structured and know when to press and when to hold, so it's been a great test of the Matildas' ability to do something that historically hasn't been one of their strengths.\n\nClare Wheeler has shuffled into midfield this half and is doing very well as a pivot player who keeps the ball moving and tries to create triangles. Charli Grant is getting pretty physical with Jayde Riviere on the far side - perhaps feeling like she has a point to prove? - but has done okay so far to keep the wings quiet.\n\nBoth teams delicately balanced at this point.\n\nBy Samantha Lewis\n\nQuinn is on for Simi Awujo, and Janine Beckie replaces Adrianna Leon.\n\nBy Samantha Lewis\n\nThe various substitutions has seen another structural change for Australia, moving into more of a 4-4-2 with Michelle Heyman and Sharn Frier up front.\n\nMary Fowler has dropped a little deeper and towards the right side of midfield now, too, floating around a bit more and getting the ball in different areas of the field.\n\nShe almost has a chance to thread a pass into Heyman's feet after pouncing on a poor pass out from Canada, but she's quickly smothered by two defenders. They know she's dangerous.\n\nTopic:Health\n\nAnalysis by Patricia Karvelas\n\nTopic:Foreign Aid\n\nTopic:Alternative Energy\n\nTopic:Courts\n\nTopic:World War 2\n\nTopic:Children's Health\n\nTopic:Activism and Lobbying\n\nTopic:Indigenous Culture\n\nWe acknowledge Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples as the First Australians and Traditional Custodians of the lands where we live, learn, and work.\n\nThis service may include material from Agence France-Presse (AFP), APTN, Reuters, AAP, CNN and the BBC World Service which is copyright and cannot be reproduced.\n\nAEST = Australian Eastern Standard Time which is 10 hours ahead of GMT (Greenwich Mean Time)"

When I was on my own on the last lap, everyone was cheering for me,\" said Hull, who was pursued by the moving trackside light that indicated she was under world-record pace.\n\n\"I was just looking at the lights, hoping they wouldn't catch me.\n\n\"There are for sure some women who can run that 5:19, but for now I have my place in the history books. I ran hard for this record, I worked extremely hard for this.\"\n\nHull said she had felt tired following her run in Paris but recovered sufficiently enough to make the start line in Monaco.\n\n\"I definitely felt the Paris race all week in my legs,\" Hull said.\n\n\"So, today the goal was just to be strong, even if my legs were very heavy. I ran at a different pace and level of fatigue that I have never been at before.\"\n\nHull has twice finished seventh in the 1,500m at the world championships.\n\nShe was 11th in the 1,500m final in her Olympic debut in Tokyo three years ago.\n\nOn a hugely encouraging night for the Australian Olympic challenge, Nina Kennedy won the women's pole vault and Mackenzie Little finished runner-up in the women's javelin.\n\nWorld champion Kennedy won on countback from Angelica Moser, clearing 4.88m at the first attempt while the Swiss went over at her third try.\n\n\"The results show us everyone is in really good form,\" Kennedy said.\n\n\"Everyone is pushing for the Olympic gold.

The NFL averages $10 billion per year, but that is with five networks. Depending on how things fare with TNT Sports, the NBA could cross the $7 billion threshold.\n\nThe NFL remains the top attraction because of its ratings and advertising prowess. The NBA is a firm second and can command top dollar due to its younger viewers as well as having a ton of content.\n\nGet top local stories in Southern California delivered to you every morning with NBC LA's News Headlines newsletter.\n\nAt least not for a couple of weeks. The NBA has a board of governors meeting in Las Vegas next week and could approve the deal there. Once the league sends the finished contracts to TNT Sports, it would have five days to match one of the deals.\n\nLeagues want economic certainty. For the networks and media companies that hold the rights, live sports continue to be prime real estate for advertisers.\n\nYou may need to go to your channel guide often, but during the last three months of the regular season there will be a national NBA telecast every night on either ABC, ESPN, NBC, Peacock or Prime Video.\n\n\n\nESPN and ABC will continue to be home to the league's marquee matchups, as well as the NBA Finals.\n\nEven though the NBA will have two broadcast partners for the first time, the Walt Disney Company was adamant about not sharing the Finals. It will cost Disney $2.6 billion per year, which is just shy of the $2.7 billion per season it pays to the NFL for Monday Night Football, two playoff games and the Super Bowl in 2027 and 2031.\n\nUnder the current nine-year deal which expires next season, ESPN/ABC pay $1.4 billion per year.\n\nNBC, the network that carried all six of Michael Jordan's title runs with the Chicago Bulls and the first three of Shaquille O'Neal and Kobe Bryant's championships with the Los Angeles Lakers, returns after carrying NBA games from 1990 through 2002.\n\nNBC's deal with the league reportedly averages $2.5 billion per season, which is more than the $2 billion it reportedly gives to the NFL for Sunday Night Football.\n\nWith that price tag comes a Sunday night package of games once the NFL regular season is over, as well as NBA All-Star Weekend. Reports indicate NBC's deal also includes regularly aired games on Tuesday nights and a package of Monday games streaming on Peacock.\n\nYes. You don't have to wait until the fall of 2025 to hear \"Roundball Rock,\" though, because NBC licenses it for its basketball coverage during the Olympics.\n\nYes, with Prime Video. It will carry games on Thursday night after the NFL regular season ends, along with games on Friday and Saturday.\n\nPrime Video will also be the main network for the NBA In-Season Tournament. It will average paying $1.8 billion per season (its deal with the NFL averages $1.1 billion per year).\n\nAll the networks will have games during the first two rounds. When it comes to the conference finals, ESPN/ABC has one series each season while NBC and Amazon Prime Video will alternate who carries the other one.\n\nLabor peace was achieved with a new Collective Bargaining Agreement. The media rights are about to be done. That puts expansion by at least two teams to 32 on deck. The expansion fees will also carry a nice financial windfall for teams.\n\nFor players, it means the league’s salary cap will see an annual 10% increase. Get ready for the possibility that the top players may be earning somewhere near $100 million per season by the mid-2030s.\n\nYes. All three partners will carry games. ESPN/ABC and Prime Video already have games while NBC will return to carrying the WNBA after doing the first six seasons (1997 through 2002). It is possible the WNBA could still add more partners like it has in recent seasons."

While the Russian grabbed the first set 7-6, it wasn't enough as Alcaraz ran away with the next three, 6-3, 6-4, 6-4.\n\nDjokovic, 37, took on Italy's Lorenzo Musetti in a tightly contested three-set semifinal match.

Djokovic currently ties Margaret Court with 24 Grand Slams. \n\nAlcaraz also has something at stake Sunday. who has been most consistent on tour this year, is working towards his fourth Grand Slam title after winning the French Open last month. At just 21 years old, the Spaniard reached major finals on all three surfaces, earning the title of the youngest to do so in history. \n\nWhile the upcoming men’s final on Sunday carries immense significance, another interesting layer is in just weeks, Alcaraz and Djokovic will return to the clay courts to take on the 2024 Paris Olympics, creating an even more potentially historic year for the duo.\n\nAlcaraz will represent Spain in singles and doubles, teaming up with legend Rafael Nadal. The tournament will likely conclude the 22-time Grand Slam champion's illustrious career.\n\nDjokovic will represent Serbia as he seeks his second Olympic medal. In 2008 Beijing, Djokovic fell in the semifinals to Nadal and went on to beat James Blake for bronze.\n\nDjokovic currently holds a 3-2 record on Alcaraz.\n\nWhile the two have yet to face off in 2024, Djokovic won the pair's last two meetings in 2023.\n\nEarlier in 2023, Alcaraz defeated Djokovic in the Wimbledon final in five sets. A few weeks prior, Djokovic beat Alcaraz in the French Open semis in four sets. \n\nThe first meeting came in 2022, which Alcaraz won. \n\nThe final is expected to go the distance based on previous outcomes and recent results. \n\nTennis fans did not expect to see Djokovic in the final of Wimbledon after he suffered a meniscus tear during the French Open and had to have surgery. Just weeks later, Djokovic returned to court and found himself relatively healthy and back to his winning ways.\n\nWhile much of the result will depend on Djokovic's health, Alcaraz has been the more dominant player in recent weeks — and not to mention, carries the momentum as the defending champion.\n\nPrediction: Alcaraz defeats Djokovic in five sets.\n\n"

A majority of that viewing is coming from sports, which have seen 66% growth to put up a whopping 12.4B minutes.\n\n\n\tMeanwhile, entertainment content has generated 6.1B minutes, a 42% lift from last summer, according to the company. \n\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tRelated Stories\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\tRatings\n\t\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tFox's Indianapolis 500 Debut Races To Highest Viewership Since 2008\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\tRatings\n\t\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t'The Last Of Us' Season 2 Finale Draws 3.7 Million Cross-Platform U.S. Viewers For HBO\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\tFox has been setting records with its viewership for both the Euros and Copa America, as Deadline has been reporting throughout the tournaments. Recently, all four semifinal matches amassed stunning viewership for soccer on U.S. English-language television, especially with the USMNT out. \n\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\tWatch on Deadline\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\tLuckily for Fox, the interest generated by soccer has translated to more eyeballs on the network in general, with all its entertainment programming benefitting from a viewership boost as well. \n\n\n\t“With audiences expecting year-round originals and sports, there’s no vacation in television,” said Fox Entertainment CEO Rob Wade.  “Getting Fox to the top spot are popular series like our new game shows The Quiz with Balls and The 1% Club, plus an outstanding lineup from our friends at Fox Sports. It’s great to see audiences beating the heat and enjoying our refreshing summer schedule.”\n\n\n\tIn the first five weeks of summer, Fox is ranking as No. 1 in entertainment programming in adults 18-49 with a 0.38 rating and adults 25-54 with a 0.54 rating after seven days of viewing. In primetime, the network is up 43% in adults 18-49, which is a significant boost. Among total viewers, Fox is up 40% year-over-year.\n\n\n\tParticularly, Fox has been seeing success with its new game shows, The 1% Club and The Quiz with Balls. The shows are tied with a 0.3 rating in the 18-49 demo after seven days of viewing.\n\n\n\tOther unscripted programming that is helping support Fox’s numbers this summer are WWE’s Smackdown, Masterchef: Generations, and Beat Shazam.\n\n\n\tWith the Copa America and Euros finals this weekend, there may be a bit of a lull for Fox’s sports programming and therefore a dip in those stellar audiences. That’s the case for most networks, though, as NBC’s Paris Olympics coverage is going to make a ton of noise that will be difficult for others to compete with on the sports programming front. \n\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\tHowever, Fox is still likely to maintain a strong audience through the summer, especially with WWE’s SummerSlam approaching in August. Smackdown is a strong, consistent performer for Fox, and it generally performs even better in conjunction with big WWE events. \n\n\n\tIt remains to be seen how the game shows and additional unscripted content will continue performing to sustain Fox through to the start of the fall broadcast season (and football season).\n\nGet our Breaking News Alerts and Keep your inbox happy.\n\nSignup for Breaking News Alerts & Newsletters\n\n\n\t\t\tBy providing your information, you agree to our Terms of Use and our Privacy Policy.\n\t\t\t\tWe use vendors that may also process your information to help provide our services.

Her grandfather is Ghanaian#3SportsGH pic.twitter.com/IIuCaNreRt\n\nHer family: Her father, Ugo, is Italian and her mother, Jacqueline grew up in Poland. Paolini’s maternal grandmother is Polish, and her maternal grandfather is Ghanaian.\n\nPaolini, like tennis player Naomi Osaka (born to Japanese and Haitian parents), embraces the multicultural aspects of her background that make her unique.\n\n“That’s a, I think, important part of my life,” Paolini said. “My mom, she’s Polish, but my grandfather is from Ghana. I think I’m fast because of Ghana. \n\nShe’s the first women’s player to reach consecutive French Open and Wimbledon finals in the same season since Serena Williams.\n\nWilliams last did that in 2016 when her victory at Wimbledon over Angelique Kerber came a month after she lost her French Open title match to Garbiñe Muguruza. \n\nThat 2016 Wimbledon title was the last for Williams at Wimbledon, where she won seven championships. \n\nSince Williams won three of the four Slams in 2015, only Iga Świątek has won multiple Grand Slam titles in the same year (she won the French and US Open in 2022).\n\nNeither Paolini nor Krejcikova have ever won a Slam at Wimbledon, so a new winner is guaranteed to hoist the trophy. \n\nNot only does Paolini join elite company in becoming the first woman since Williams to play in consecutive French Open and Wimbledon finals, she’s also the oldest player (28) to reach their first semifinals in different Slams since 1977.\n\n1 – Jasmine Paolini is the oldest player to reach their first semi-finals in two different Grand Slams during the same season since Betty Stove in 1977. Mesmerize. #Wimbledon | @wimbledon @WTA @WTA_insider pic.twitter.com/2q8mLscdi8\n\n“Two Grand Slams in a row was crazy to believe,” Paolini said after her semifinal win. \n\nPaolini had never advanced past the second round of a major before this year.\n\nPaolini was ranked No. 31 entering the 2024 Australian Open in January, and even as she got past the second round of a major for the first time in her career by winning her first three matches. Those wins came over players ranked No. 92 (Diana Shnaider in the round of 128), No. 42 (Tatjana Maria in the round of 64) and No. 57 (Anna Blinkova in the round of 32). \n\nNo earth-shattering wins there, but it was progress (she lost in the round of 16 to Anna Kalinskaya, ranked No. 75 at the time, in straight sets). \n\nGetting a sniff of her first solid run at a major clearly boosted Paolini’s confidence. She won her first WTA 1000 tournament in February at the Dubai Duty Free Tennis Championships, losing only two sets the entire tournament. After Elena Rybakina withdrew from the quarterfinals in Dubai, Paolini advanced to her first WTA 1000 semifinal. \n\nHer run to the finals of the French Open was anything but a breeze as Paolini battled through three consecutive three-set matches (the last one to go the distance was a quarterfinal win over No. 4 Elena Rybakina).\n\nPaolini lost to Swiatek, the top player in women’s tennis, in the French Open final.\n\nBefore 2024, Paolini had never won a main draw pro match on grass.\n\nBefore this year’s Wimbledon, the WTA posted its top 15 rankings of the most dominant women on that surface. \n\nOns Jabeur, world No. 10, was first.\n\nCoco Gauff, world No. 2, was 15th.\n\nSwiatek, world No. 1, didn’t make the list. \n\nPaolini, of course, was not likely on the radar.\n\nShe entered this year having never won a grass court match in the main draw of a pro tournament, having played her pro career among all levels of pro tennis (ITF events, qualifying draws and WTA tournaments). Her career record on the grass courts at Wimbledon before this year: 0-3.\n\nBut there were signs that Paolini might have some success entering Wimbledon as she reached the semifinals on the grass courts of the Rothesay International tournament in Eastbourne, Great Britain (a WTA 500 event), by winning her first two matches.\n\nWith the wins at Eastbourne and Wimbledon, Paolini has now won eight of her last nine grass court matches.\n\n“Maybe I didn’t realize before, but my coach was telling me that I could play well here,” Paolini said after winning her Wimbledon quarterfinal match. “I wasn’t believing too much … In Eastbourne.

        "expanded content": "Nine’s Wide World of Sports\n\nNovak Djokovic said his free pass into the Wimbledon semi-finals is fortunate, considering Alex de Minaur's \"red hot\" run at Wimbledon this year.\n\nDe Minaur, who was seeded ninth at the All England Club, announced he was pulling out of the tournament hours before he and Djokovic were scheduled to play each other at Centre Court.\n\nThe walkover placed Djokovic in the Wimbledon semi-finals for the 13th time, equalling Roger Federer for the most by a man in tournament history.\n\nREAD MORE: Aussies topple favourites to reach Wimbledon final\n\nREAD MORE: 'Terrific' Tevita puts rivals on notice in Dolphins win\n\nREAD MORE: Awkward Olympics truth exposed by Aussie stars\n\n\"It is obviously not great for the tournament and it is never great to go through with a withdrawal of a player and I wish Alex the best in terms of his recovery,\" he told The Tennis Channel.\n\n\"We hope he can come back to the court. Some people were guessing whether it was an ankle, some people wondered whether it was a hip or an ankle and it is terrible. It is the biggest enemy of an athlete, injury, and I wish him a speedy recovery.\n\n\"He was in red hot form and it would be a really tough match for both of us. But it is what it is and I am moving on to the semis.\"\n\nThere's no single explanation, of course, for all of the injuries to players in the latter stages at Wimbledon this year. This much is certain: The timing could hardly be worse.\n\nIn addition to de Minaur, Alexander Zverev, slipped on an unworn patch of green grass in his previous match. That caused a bone bruise — and maybe worse — that Zverev complained left him on \"one leg\" in his loss to Taylor Fritz at what the two-time major finalist characterised as a wide open opportunity to grab a first grand slam title.\n\nDanielle Collins' last Wimbledon appearance before retirement ended with tape wrapped around her hamstring, the work of a trainer during the American's fourth-round loss to 2021 French Open champion Barbora Krejcikova. Collins chalked it up to failing to \"think about every little step that you take.\"\n\nWatch Wimbledon 2024 live and exclusively free on Nine and 9Now. Plus centre court in 4K UHD on Stan Sport, the home of grand slam tennis.\n\n\"There's been a ton of injuries on the grass. Left and right, it seems like people are going down. I am, I guess, frustrated that I feel like I was focusing on my tactics and kind of what I needed to do to play at a high level. Usually, I feel like, on other surfaces you're not having to think so critically about your movement,\" Collins said. \"The one second I take my mind off of it, not think about every little thing I'm doing with my footwork, it ends up happening.\"\n\nThe falls keep happening. The injuries are adding up.\n\n\"It's unfortunate, obviously,\" de Minaur said. \"You never want to see this.\"\n\nHe called his mishap \"more of a freak injury,\" related to the \"excessive amount of force\" used to slide on grass.\n\nMadison Keys, the 2017 US Open runner-up, was in tears when she stopped because of a hurt leg at 5-all in the third set of a second week match against Jasmine Paolini.\n\nEmma Raducanu, who won the US Open three years ago, withdrew from mixed doubles — which was supposed to be Andy Murray's last event at Wimbledon — because of a sore wrist, then needed a medical timeout later that day after falling in the third set of a singles loss.\n\nNo.17 Anna Kalinskaya cited a bad wrist when she quit in her fourth-round match against 2022 champion Elena Rybakina. No.10 Grigor Dimitrov retired from his fourth-round match against Daniil Medvedev with a leg problem.\n\n\"It's normal for the second week at Wimbledon to be feeling niggling things on your muscles, because it's tough — the grass, getting down low, coming into the net. It's more on the muscles than the joints on the grass,\" 2003 Wimbledon finalist Mark Philippoussis said. \"So I'm sure lots of people will be feeling it now with little things here and there.\"\n\nCount Djokovic among those who think part of the issue is that all of the rain during the tournament — so much that the mixed doubles final was shifted from Thursday to Sunday, and play began a half-hour earlier than usual on most courts Wednesday — has made the grass more slick and the footing less sure.\n\nSo has shutting the retractable roofs at Centre Court and No.1 Court, the only two arenas with that luxury during wet weather.\n\n\"Once you close the roof, you know that the grass is going to be more slippery. So there's more chances that players will fall. Unfortunately, some of the falls have caused some of the players to withdraw,\" Djokovic said.\n\n\"It's part of this surface. You can't really change that,\" added the seven-time champion at the All England Club. \"I mean, it's grass. It's a live surface, and it reacts to different conditions.\"\n\nThe pattern began at grass tourneys that preceded Wimbledon.\n\nMarketa Vondrousova retired from a match in Berlin after hurting her right leg there. When she showed up at Wimbledon, she became the first defending champion in 30 years to lose in the first round and acknowledged: \"I was a bit scared because of my leg.\"\n\nThe woman who beat her last week, Jessica Bouzas Maneiro, stopped at Wimbledon because of a back issue in the third round against Krejcikova.\n\nFrances Tiafoe pulled out of the Queen's Club tournament before Wimbledon after spraining a ligament in his right knee when he took a tumble. Tiafoe played at the All England Club with a black sleeve over his knee and made it to the third round before losing to defending champion Carlos Alcaraz.\n\nDjokovic tore the meniscus in his right knee during a match at the French Open, had surgery and returned to competition less than a month later. Ironically, he thinks it's possible that might have helped him stay upright this fortnight.\n\nThat's because, years ago, Djokovic was one of the first players to regularly slide on grass the way they do on clay. He has cut down on those movements this time at Wimbledon, being extra careful to avoid risking falls.\n\n\"It's probably part of my, I guess, different kind of movement on the court that I've been really experimenting with because of the cautiousness — because of the knee and everything that was happening prior to the tournament,\" Djokovic explained. \"The first couple rounds, I was still not maybe willing to go (for difficult) balls and slide and make splits.\"\n\nOther theories include: More and more baseline play on grass, and less serving-and-volleying, creates longer points and extra running, which translate into a greater likelihood of slips; less comfort on grass because players tend to grow up practising and competing on clay or hard courts; and a brief grass portion of the schedule that doesn't allow for accumulating a lot of experience on the turf.\n\nThen there's the general wear-and-tear of a season.\n\n\"Listen, tennis is a very physical sport at the moment. For sure, the rallies are longer. Matches. Scheduling. Finishing late,\" 2006 Australian Open finalist Marcos Baghdatis said. \"It's very demanding on the body. ... A lot of things are changing that (contribute) to players getting injured.\"\n\n8 minutes ago\n\n37 minutes ago\n\n1 hour ago\n\n© 2025 Nine Entertainment Co."

Plus centre court in 4K UHD on Stan Sport, the home of grand slam tennis.\n\nPaolini never had won a match at the All England Club until last week and now will participate in her second consecutive grand slam final, thanks to the rollicking 2-6, 6-4, 7-6 (10-8) victory over the unseeded Vekic across 2 hours, 51 minutes on Centre Court.\n\nVekic often was in obvious distress, crying between points and while sitting in her changeover chair late in the third set — because, she said afterward, of pain in an arm and a leg — and often looked up at her guest box with a flushed face. She iced her right forearm between games.\n\nDonna Vekic sobs late in the third set. Nine\n\n\"Vekic is crying - a lot,\" tennis journalist Jose Morgado tweeted.\n\n“I thought I was going to die in the third set,” said Vekic, who repeatedly closed her eyes, sighed or shook her head during her news conference.\n\n“I didn’t know how,” she said, “I could keep playing.”\n\nREAD MORE: Aussies topple favourites to reach Wimbledon final\n\nREAD MORE: 'Terrific' Tevita puts rivals on notice in Dolphins win\n\nREAD MORE: Awkward Olympics truth exposed by Aussie stars\n\nFormer player Pam Shriver and Vekic's team express support from the stands. Nine\n\nConsider: Vekic, making her debut in a Slam semi-final, ended up claiming more points (118-111), delivering more winners (42-26) and breaking serve more often (4-3), yet in the end her unforced error count (57)\n\nBut Paolini's never-give-up attitude was apparent at 4-all in the second, when she sprinted with her back to the net to put her racket on a lob, somehow getting it back over the net, and Vekic badly missed an overhead.\n\nPaolini held there to lead 5-4, then broke for the set with a forehand winner, looked up at her guest box — where her relatives and her doubles partner, Sara Errani, were on their feet — and screamed, “Forza!” (“Let’s go!”)\n\nVekic, playing her fifth three-setter in six matches, headed to the locker room before the last set, recalibrated and came out strong.\n\nShe broke in the opening game, helped by a forehand return winner on a second serve, followed by Paolini’s missed forehand on an 11-stroke exchange.\n\nDonna Vekic could not hold her emotions during and after the longest semi-final women's match in history at Wimbledon. Nine\n\nSoon Vekic led 3-1. After a later trade of breaks, she was up 4-3.\n\n“I believed I could win,” Vekic said, “until the end.”\n\nPaolini will now face No. 31 Barbora Krejcikova for the title.\n\nThe same could be said of the second semi-final, which lasted 44 fewer minutes but contained its own share of plot twists as 2021 French Open champion Krejcikova came back to eliminate 2022 Wimbledon champion Elena Rybakina 3-6, 6-3, 6-4.\n\nWhoever wins on Saturday will be the eighth woman to leave the All England Club with the title in the past eight editions of the tournament.\n\nKrejcikova trailed 4-0 at the start, reeled off four of five games to take the second set, then earned the pivotal break to move ahead 5-3 in the third against Rybakina, who entered the day with a 19-2 career mark at the All England Club.\n\n“During the second set, somewhere in the middle, I was getting my momentum,” Krejcikova said. “And when I broke her, I started to be in a zone — and I didn’t want to leave the zone.”\n\n8 minutes ago\n\n37 minutes ago\n\n1 hour ago\n\n© 2025 Nine Entertainment Co."

Follow five Australian athletes in their quest to compete at the world’s largest sporting events in Paris 2024.\n\nAlistair Donohoe is a man consumed with Paralympic gold — boldly unafraid to declare his ambitions, but tortured by past failures. \n\nMelissa Wu is defying history at 32, aiming for a record fifth Olympics, continuing an exceptional elite career which started when she was just a child. \n\nNoemie Fox is on a seemingly impossible journey to navigate one of the toughest qualification pathways in any sport, to join the rest of her family as an Olympian. \n\nCampbell Harrison wants to create a more inclusive sporting environment for all, especially queer athletes, and is using sport climbing to lead the way. \n\nAnd Jamieson Leeson never thought she'd ever be able to participate in sport — now she's a Paralympic gold medal favourite. \n\nThese athletes share all in ABC Sport's new documentary, Countdown to Paris.\n\nAlistair Donohoe was within reach of gold at the Rio 2016 Paralympics, and it's something which haunts him constantly. \n\nDonohoe was in a sprint finish in the road race, and well placed to edge out Ukranian competitior Yehor Dementyev. \n\nBut Dementyev clipped Donohoe's bike, sending both men crashing and the Australian desperately running to the finish line.\n\nDonohoe (right) crashes as he approaches the finish line of the road race at the Rio Paralympics. (PA Images/Alamy: Andrew Matthews)\n\n\"But my bike didn't cross, so I didn't win,\" Donohoe says.  \n\n\"That definitely put an emotional setback on me because I put so much energy and time and investment into winning this gold medal, I cared so much about it. \n\n\"And then it literally got ripped away from me.\n\n\"Unfortunately it's kind of scary coming towards Paris. If I don't win it, it's going to f***ing hurt. And I'm just going to have to prepare myself that might be the outcome.\"\n\nExpectation used to overwhelm Noemie Fox, now she's embracing it.  \n\nNoemie Fox competing in the kayak cross at the Australian Open. (ABC Sport: Amanda Shalala)\n\nCanoe slalom has been a dominant presence throughout her entire life, with parents Myriam and Richard, and sister Jessica, all Olympians. \n\nJess also happens to be the most successful paddler in history, and has previously blocked Noemie's hopes of competing at the Olympics, taking Australia's only available quota positions.\n\n\"Having a sister that is the GOAT in our sport, so the greatest of all time, comes with its challenges and advantages,\" Fox says.\n\nJessica Fox is an eight-time world champion and four-time Olympic medallist. (Getty Images: Sam Mellish)\n\n\"When I was growing up, it was much harder not having that sense of identity or constantly comparing and then having extended family members being like, 'oh, you do the sport too?'\"\n\nBut for the first time Noemie had an Olympic opening with an additional quota position available in the new discipline of kayak cross. \n\nTo get it, she had to finish in the top three athletes at the global qualification event in Prague. \n\n\"It's so incredible to be able to fully commit to something and see where that takes you and say, well, at least I gave it everything,\" she says.\n\n\"I'd rather be shattered and heartbroken and there'll only be good things that came from it, the strength, that mental focus, mental resilience.\"\n\nFor the past two decades Melissa Wu's life has centred on elite diving. \n\nWu started her elite diving career when she was just 13. (Getty Images: Vladimir Rys)\n\nHer first major international competition came as a 13-year-old at the 2006 Melbourne Commonwealth Games, and an Olympic debut two years later. \n\nShe decided to give history a shake, and become the first Australian diver to contest five Olympics. \n\n\"It's the first time in my career I've just really dived for me and with not as much pressure, just enjoying it,\" she says.\n\n\"After Tokyo, finally having won that [bronze] medal, I could take a bit of a breath and be like, OK we've done it now.\n\nWu competing at the World Championships earlier this year. (Getty Images)\n\n\"Even though I enjoyed that journey, that process definitely took a bit of a toll mentally and physically. \n\n\"But now I look at it as bonus time.\"\n\nCampbell Harrison is a sport climber, and the benefit of being in one of the newest Olympic sports is the ability to help shape its culture, as a member of the International Federation of Sport Climbing Athletes' Commission.\n\nCampbell Harrison competing in sport climbing. (Getty Images: Marco Kost)\n\n\"Older, more traditional sports like AFL in Australia, there's this assumption that it's very masculine, it's these macho characteristics of strength and power and aggression,\" he says.\n\n\"And I think that can be quite scary and intimidating, especially to women and also to young queer people who are so accustomed to keeping out of the limelight.\n\n\"Especially those of us who felt like being queer was a secret that we had to hide, at risk to our safety and wellbeing. \n\n\"Putting yourself out there in that kind of sporting environment doesn't really feel like a safe place for people who are a little bit different. \n\n\"And I think those of us who exist in younger, newer sports like climbing, for instance, have this really unique opportunity to build in a positive culture from the grassroots. \n\n\"We have this almost blank slate upon which we can build our sport and instil these values.\"\n\nJamieson Leeson wasn't interested in playing boccia when it was first introduced to her while at school. \n\n\"Growing up in the small country town of Dunedoo in New South Wales, with such a significant physical disability, there wasn't many sports, if any, available for me,\" Leeson says.\n\nBoccia B3 pairs world number one ranked team Dan Michel and Jamieson Leeson.  (AAP: Bianca De Marchi)\n\n\"So for the majority of my childhood, was spent sitting on the sidelines cheering on my friends and my siblings in whatever sport they were doing, and I was the biggest fan of sport.\"\n\nAfter some initial resistance, Leeson's participation in boccia, one of the few sports available for people with severe disabilities, has turned into a life changing career, where she's now part of the world number one BC3 pairs team alongside Dan Michel.\n\n\"It's given me so much more to my life that I didn't have before and taken me and given me so many opportunities that I never knew I could even have,\" she says.\n\nCountdown to Paris is available to watch above, or on ABC iview and ABC News In-Depth on YouTube.\n\nTopic:NRL\n\nTopic:Paralympic Games\n\nTopic:Sport\n\nTopic:Police\n\nTopic:State of Origin\n\nTopic:Health\n\nAnalysis by Patricia Karvelas\n\nTopic:Foreign Aid\n\nTopic:Alternative Energy\n\nTopic:Courts\n\nTopic:Royalty\n\nTopic:Health\n\nTopic:Foreign Aid\n\nAustralia\n\nBoccia\n\nCanoeing and Kayaking\n\nDarwin\n\nDiving\n\nDunedoo\n\nHomebush Bay\n\nMelbourne\n\nOlympic Games\n\nParalympic Games\n\nPenrith\n\nRoad Cycle Racing\n\nSport\n\nTrack Cycling\n\nTopic:Health\n\nAnalysis by Patricia Karvelas\n\nTopic:Foreign Aid\n\nTopic:Alternative Energy\n\nTopic:Courts\n\nTopic:World War 2\n\nTopic:Children's Health\n\nTopic:Activism and Lobbying\n\nTopic:Indigenous Culture\n\nWe acknowledge Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples as the First Australians and Traditional Custodians of the lands where we live, learn, and work.\n\nThis service may include material from Agence France-Presse (AFP), APTN, Reuters, AAP, CNN and the BBC World Service which is copyright and cannot be reproduced.\n\nAEST = Australian Eastern Standard Time which is 10 hours ahead of GMT (Greenwich Mean Time)"

The feat won't be matched by any other accolade throughout their career.\n\nFor most - but certainly not for all.\n\nREAD MORE: Aussies topple favourites to reach Wimbledon final\n\nREAD MORE: 'Terrific' Tevita puts rivals on notice in Dolphins win\n\nREAD MORE: Heeney's Brownlow dream over after marathon hearing\n\nIt's why the golfers selected to wear the green and gold at Le Golf National have mixed reactions when asked where the Olympics ranks on their to-do list.\n\nGolf featured at the Games in 1900 and 1904 but then disappeared from the schedule for 112 years.\n\nWhen it returned for the Rio 2016 event, the world's No.1 ranked man opted out of competing.\n\nAussie golfers Adam Scott, Min Woo Lee and Jason Day. PGA TOUR\n\nThat was Aussie star Jason Day.\n\nDay had climbed to the top of the world rankings on the back of winning the 2015 PGA Championship - his first and only major triumph to date - and the 2016 Players Championship, which is colloquially known as golf's fifth major.\n\nPut bluntly, the Olympics did not hold the same allure as the tournaments Day was competing in from week to week as a professional.\n\n\"It was never really a thought that I'd be able to play in the Olympics, because it wasn't ever a part of it until just recently,\" Day told Australian media after being named as one of four Olympic golfers.\n\nWatch every moment, every medal of the Olympics Games Paris 2024 live and free on Channel 9 and 9Now. Plus, every event ad-free and in 4K on Stan Sport.\n\n\"I (now) get nervous about the possibility of winning a gold medal - even just a medal in general - which means that I really want to.\"\n\nDay did, however, suggest his motivation for winning an Olympic medal does come with an ulterior motive.\n\n\"Currently I've got one major championship, I've got one Players Championship, got 13 (PGA Tour) wins... am I on the outside looking in on the Hall of Fame? Maybe, I'm not sure,\" he said.\n\n\"But if I do win a gold medal I honestly feel that will push me over the edge (of Hall of Fame induction).\n\n\"Knowing that I'm in the Olympics now and representing Australia, it feels different. People have worked their whole life to get to this point.\n\n\"It (will be) really cool to look back when I'm retired... that I did represent Australia at the Olympics.\"\n\nMin Woo Lee and Minjee Lee high five. Getty\n\nWhile Day was chatting via a Zoom call from America he was looking at his trophy cabinet, that includes 13 PGA Tour trophies as well as the esteemed Wanamaker Trophy - the PGA Championship cup that stands 75cm tall and weighs 12 kilograms.\n\nAn Olympic medal - even of the gold variety - would be dwarfed, physically speaking, when put next to that piece of silverware.\n\nThe other factor for professional golfers is money.\n\nAcross his 16 seasons on the PGA Tour, Day has earned about USD$60.5 million in prize money alone. In today's exchange rate that's more than $90m Australian.\n\nEven his Olympic teammate Min Woo Lee, 25, has earned USD$5.5m in just 43 events.\n\nLast week their countryman Cam Davis - who did not qualify for the Olympics - pocketed AUD$2.5m for winning his second PGA Tour event.\n\nThe Australian Olympic Committee will pay gold medallists $20,000 for a win in Paris. A silver medal will net them $15,000 while bronze is $10,000. Most athletes won't be paid unless they finish on the podium.\n\nFor top professional sports like golf, tennis and basketball, the risk is arguably not worth the possibility of a medal around their neck.\n\nFor some, it's more advantageous to use the Olympic period to take a break from competing.\n\nMinjee Lee - Australia's second-ranked women's golfer and two-time major winner - does not agree.\n\nMajor winner Minjee Lee of Australia. Getty\n\n\"The Olympics is something a bit bigger than just playing for yourself, you're playing for your country,\" she told Australian media last week.\n\n\"It's the biggest honour you could have in terms of playing for your country.\n\n\"I know week in week out we do represent Australia, but we're not playing for Australia, and the atmosphere (at the Olympics) is just a little different.\n\n\"You've got to be there to experience it.\"\n\nLee - who will be joined by Hannah Green in the women's contingent for Australia - was speaking on the same Zoom call as her younger brother Min Woo.\n\nMin Woo was a teenager when golf returned to the Olympics in Rio, and he admits a gold medal was not always on his to-do list.\n\n\"I think it's very high up there now. At first it was like, not really... growing up for the swimming, for track, the Olympics was the biggest thing,\" he explained.\n\n\"I think golf is definitely becoming that way. It's up there... maybe not like the Masters, or the majors, but right behind it for sure.\n\n\"To call yourself a gold medallist is very cool for your resume, and it's nearly as cool as winning a major I guess.\"\n\nMinjee is heading to her third Olympics, while her brother and Day will be there for the first time.\n\nYet the contrast in their reactions to the same question highlight the awkward reality of global professional sports at the Games.\n\n8 minutes ago\n\n37 minutes ago\n\n1 hour ago\n\n© 2025 Nine Entertainment Co."

That was supposed to be a joke.\n\n\"We're proud of our partners, obviously. This is about putting together a team.\"\n\nWhen Brown was drafted by the Celtics in 2016, he signed a shoe deal with adidas. He wore adidas for the first five seasons of his career but his contract expired in 2021.\n\nBrown has not signed a shoe deal since then, playing as a sneaker free agent for the past three seasons.\n\nDuring that time Brown has mostly worn Nike's Kobe Bryant signature shoe, without having a deal, even having the ticks taken off the sides of the shoes.\n\nHe also criticised Nike after the shoe giant cut Kyrie Irving after making a social media posts that were deemed insensitive.\n\nAfter winning the 2024 crown, the only other thing Brown needs on his resume is an appearance for Team USA.\n\nThe Celtics forward entered the league in 2016 and was considered for both the 2020 and 2024 USA men's basketball teams, but never made the cut\n\n\"Playing for USA Basketball, I think there is no greater honour,\" Brown said. \"... Being able to participate would be very cool,\" he said leading into the NBA season.\n\nWhite averaged 15.2 points and 5.2 assists for the Celtics this past season. His selection gives Boston three of the 12 players on the U.S. roster; Celtics teammates Jayson Tatum and Jrue Holiday also are Paris-bound.\n\nJaylen Brown #7 of the Boston Celtics shoots during practice at the Auerbach Center. (Photo by Matt Stone/MediaNews Group/Boston Herald via Getty Images) MediaNews Group via Getty Images\n\n“I am happy to announce that Derrick will compete at his first Olympic Games on the heels of a championship season in Boston,” USA Basketball managing director Grant Hill said. “We look forward to him joining the team in the coming days as we continue preparations for Paris.\n\n“I want to thank Kawhi for his commitment to the USA Men’s National Team,\" Hill added. \"He earned the opportunity to represent the United States, but USA Basketball and Clippers leadership felt it’s important to allow Kawhi to prepare for the NBA season.”\n\nWhite — a second-team All-Defensive selection after this past NBA season, meaning he'll clearly take some of the on-ball defending duties that the Olympic team likely envisioned Leonard having — has some USA Basketball experience, including being part of the 2019 World Cup team that finished seventh in China.\n\nHe and the Celtics agreed on a four-year extension worth nearly $186 million after the playoff run, one in which he led Boston with 65 made 3-pointers on a team-best 40.4 percent shooting from beyond the arc.\n\nLeonard is a two-time NBA champion, six-time All-Star and six-time All-NBA player, but injury issues have been a recurring theme in his career. USA Basketball had monitored him closely in recent weeks, making sure he was doing well enough to be on the court after his season with the Clippers ended prematurely.\n\n(L to R) Kristaps Porzingis #8, Jaylen Brown #7, Jayson Tatum #0, and Derrick White #9 of the Boston Celtics look on during the second quarter against the Dallas Mavericks in Game Two of the 2024 NBA Finals at TD Garden on June 09, 2024 in Boston, Massachusetts.

He appeared in 68 games this past season for the Clippers, his most since playing in 74 for San Antonio during the 2016-17 season.\n\n“This is just my journey,” Leonard said earlier this week, discussing his injuries. “I can’t lay out the perfect script for me. Last year I tried to play as much as possible, felt great and at a certain period of time I couldn't go. I tried the best that I could, but it’s just my journey. I don’t want to be in a situation that (I'm) in, but I've got to take it for what it is. And a lot of people are watching, supporters or doubters. But I motivate a lot of people, so I've got to keep doing what I’m doing.”\n\nLeonard — part of a 592-person Olympic team formally named by the U.S. Olympic and Paralympic Committee earlier Wednesday — had said earlier this week that his knee was fine and he was able to resume on-court training about three weeks ago to get ready for the Games.\n\n“I’m ready to go,” Leonard said then. “I’m playing now so, I’m happy.”\n\nA couple of days later, hours before the first U.S. exhibition game against Canada and one day before the team departs for Abu Dhabi — the first of two international stops for more games and practices before arriving in France for the Olympics — Leonard was gone.\n\nLeonard's departure leaves the U.S., at least until White arrives, with 10 available players. Kevin Durant will not play against Canada because of a calf strain and could not compete in the team's four-day training camp in Las Vegas that ended Tuesday. USA Basketball is working under the expectation that Durant will be ready for increasingly more on-court activity in the coming days.\n\nLeonard had been invited to be part of USA Basketball teams in the past and had to decline for various reasons, primarily injury issues or long playoff runs.\n\n“I always wanted to play against other talent overseas or just other basketball styles and players,” Leonard said. “It is one of the reasons why I play the game.”\n\n8 minutes ago\n\n37 minutes ago\n\n1 hour ago\n\n© 2025 Nine Entertainment Co."

Thinaah in action during training. — FAIHAN GHANI/The Star\n\nKUALA LUMPUR: Six months of sparring with the Indonesian boys has done a world of good for Pearly Tan-M. Thinaah ahead of the Paris Olympic Games.\n\nThe duo believe they are in their best shape for their first Olympics stint.\n\nWorld No. 13 Pearly-Thinaah have been training with four former Indonesian doubles players since February to sharpen their attacking play.\n\nIn fact, these boys will also join them for their two-week training camp in Paris.\n\nThinaah said the quality sessions have helped them to develop variety in their game.\n\n“Each of them have different characteristics. It has really helped us learn and adapt to an even wider range of game plays and tactics because of their different playing styles,” said Thinaah.\n\nThe four are Ade Yusuf, Gerardo Rizqullah, Rian Swastedian and Alfian Firsada.\n\nAde was ranked world No. 16 with Wahyu Nayaka in 2015 while Gerardo is the nephew to the late Markis Kido, who won the 2008 Beijing Olympics gold with Hendra Setiawan.\n\nRian was the mixed doubles champion with Masita Mahmudin at the 2015 Vietnam International Series tournament and Alfian Firsada played with Alwi Mahardika before he stopped playing in 2017.\n\n“It was good to play with these players because they are so different and I learnt to vary my game and focus more on how to face players with tricky attacking shots.”\n\nPearly is looking positive.\n\n“We are currently giving our best at training sessions. We have regained our rhythm just like how we performed at the Indonesian Open.”\n\nAt the Indonesian Open in June, the pair gave a good fight before bowing out 20-22, 18-21 to world No. 1 Chen Qingchen-Jia Yifan of China in the quarter-finals.\n\nNational coaching director Rexy Mainaky believed Pearly-Thinaah can give top pairs like Qingchen-Yifan and South Korea’s world No. 2 Baek Ha-na-Lee So-hee following the training with the Indonesians.\n\n“The quality sparring will help them to give a courageous fight against these top pairs,” said Rexy.\n\nHe extended his gratitude to the Road to Gold (RTG) committee for accommodating his request for the sparring players.\n\n“I highly appreciate RTG’s support for they have allowed us to do what we want in terms of training for the badminton athletes.\n\n“They have given a 100% of their effort and now it is up to the players to deliver their best performance in the arena.”\n\n \n\nThank you for your report!\n\nCopyright © 1995-\n            \n\n Star Media Group Berhad [197101000523 (10894-D)]\n\nBest viewed on Chrome browsers.\n\n\n\nWe would love to keep you posted on the latest promotion.

It has helped in reducing fat and improving muscle strength,” said Aaron.\n\n“We hope with lighter weight, we will be able to give an improved performance at the Olympics.\n\n“I think we have improved a lot on physical condition over the last few weeks as we have gone all out in training.\n\n“We want to keep a low profile heading to the Olympics and I feel that being unseeded for Paris is also an advantage for us.”\n\nOnly the top four pairs – Liang Weikeng-Wang Chang of China, Denmark’s Kim Astrup-Anders Skaarup Rasmussen, India’s Satwiksairaj Rankireddy-Chirag Shetty and Kang Min-hyuk-Seo Seung-jae of South Korea – will be seeded in Paris.\n\n“We also want to approach this Olympics as though we are playing for the first time,” said Aaron.\n\nThey played at the 2020 Tokyo Games and saved Malaysia the blushes by winning badminton solitary medal – a bronze.\n\nAaron-Wooi Yik overcame then world No. 1 Markus Fernaldi-Kevin Sanjaya of Indonesia in the quarter-finals and beat another experienced Indonesian combination Muhammad Ahsan-Hendra Setiawan en route to a podium finish in their debut.\n\nHowever, Aaron said all those exploits and their ground-breaking triumph at the 2022 World Championships will be forgotten as they want to approach Paris cautiously.\n\n“The men’s doubles will be very competitive this time and the seeded pairs will have intense pressure compared to others,” said Aaron.\n\n“Of course, we would want to try and achieve what no Malaysian have ever done before (win a gold) but more importantly, we want to enjoy every match we play and perform without pressure.”\n\nWooi Yik had also decided to stay at the Academy Badminton Malaysia’s (ABM) hostel since last month and this has also helped him focus totally on his preparation for the Olympics.\n\n“Of course fitness and strength is going to help us in Paris because we will have tough matches in the group and knockout stage. So, physically and mentally, we will be prepared for the challenge,” said Wooi Yik.\n\n“We know what is expected of Aaron and me and we just want to use the remaining weeks to be in our best condition to prove what we are capable of.”\n\nOn paper, Aaron-Wooi Yik may not appear the favourites for a podium finish but their strong track record in major events and ideal physical could help them send shockwaves in Paris.\n\n \n\nThank you for your report!\n\nCopyright © 1995-\n            \n\n Star Media Group Berhad [197101000523 (10894-D)]\n\nBest viewed on Chrome browsers.\n\n\n\nWe would love to keep you posted on the latest promotion.

(AP: Alberto Pezzali)\n\nAsh Barty worked out how to navigate the highs and lows during her stunning career, which is why she is well-placed to give de Minaur advice on how to bounce back from his latest setback.\n\nDe Minaur was forced to withdraw from his quarterfinal against Novak Djokovic on Wednesday night, Australian time, due to a hip injury.\n\nThe men's world number nine was devastated but Barty — who won the 2021 Wimbledon women's title — had some words of wisdom for her compatriot.\n\n\"I'm broken for Alex,\" Barty said.\n\n\"You could see how much it means to him. Like he said, this was the biggest match of his life. This was the opportunity that he had worked so hard for. To have something awful like that happen.\n\n\"But he is a resilient athlete. He's a ripping guy. I know that this will be a challenge, but there will be a silver lining somewhere along the way that he'll grow from, absolutely.\n\n\"He's too intelligent and too driven and passionate and motivated to not learn from it and not grow from it.\n\n\"It hurts, though. Absolutely you can't hide behind the fact that it's awful. You have to be able to accept it.\n\n\"It's okay to let it be flattening for a while but he will, I'm sure, be able to come back. When he's back on the court and fit and healthy, he'll be doing what he does best again.\"\n\nDe Minaur faces the prospect of more heartbreak, with his Olympic dream now set to be dashed.\n\nAlex de Minaur's \"freak\" hip injury was caused by a manoeuvre the Australian admitted to being \"a little bit scared of\".\n\nHis race to get to the Paris Games — the tennis program starts in 17 days — looks likely to be a losing one, with de Minaur due to play both singles and doubles alongside Alexei Popyrin.\n\nDe Minaur says he will follow the advice from his support staff, but hinted the Olympics may be off-limits.\n\n\"They haven't been able to give me a definite recovery time because it's such a unique injury,\" he said.\n\n\"Right now, it could be anywhere from three to six weeks out. It just depends how quickly my body heals.\"\n\nAsh Barty (right) teamed up with Casey Dellacqua for a bit of fun at Wimbledon. (Getty Images: Clive Brunskill)\n\nThree years to the day since she became Wimbledon singles champion, Barty made a hit-and-giggle, winning return to Centre Court.\n\nPlaying alongside her best mate Casey Dallacqua in the legends' invitation doubles, Barty could not have looked happier.\n\nThe former world number one provided a few tantalising glimpses of the quality play we've all really been missing in her absence.\n\nThe Australians ended up beating Andrea Petkovic and Magdaléna Rybáriková 5-7, 6-3 (10-7) but, in truth, nobody cared about the score.\n\nIt was just uplifting to see the 28-year-old, now a mother of a one-year-old boy, having a bit of fun with her old pal.\n\n\"It felt incredible,\" Barty said.\n\n\"Obviously, this is the place that holds some of my most cherished memories, and it's really nice to be back with my best mate on the court. It's pretty special.\"\n\nLater, when a reporter asked Barty about whether she would contemplate a return to professional tennis, she quickly put him right with a flowing backhand.\n\n\"You guys are killing me. I don't know how much more. Anyone have a thesaurus for a word that I can use for 'no'?\" she sighed.\n\n\"No, mate. No, I'm not.\"\n\nDe Minaur's exit gave seven-time champion Djokovic safe passage through to the semifinals where he will meet Italian Lorenzo Musetti.\n\nMusetti moved into his first major semifinal by outlasting big-hitting American 13th seed Taylor Fritz 3-6, 7-6 (7/5), 6-2, 3-6, 6-1.\n\nFor all the latest on and off the court, join Lauren Bordin, John Millman and John Alexander for the ABC Tennis Podcast on ABC listen.\n\nSeeded 25th at the All England Club, Musetti says his son Ludovico, who was born in March, has helped him rededicate himself to his sport and strive to no longer \"throw away matches\".\n\n\"Instead of me teaching him, he's teaching me … having a child makes you reflect a lot,\" Musetti said.\n\n\"I feel more mature on the court, more mature off the court, and more mature as a player, as a father, as a person.\"\n\nMusetti has beaten Djokovic once in six matches.\n\nHe dragged the Serb to five sets in their most recent encounter at this year's French Open.\n\nQueen Camilla watches on from the Royal Box on Centre Court. (Getty Images: Clive Brunskill)\n\nA single-minded focus has helped drive fourth seed Elena Rybakina's Wimbledon campaign as she looks to add a second title after winning in 2022.\n\nRybakina reached the semifinals with a clinical 6-3, 6-2 victory over 21st seed Elina Svitolina.\n\nThe highest seed left in the women's draw, Rybakina was so fixated with the task at hand that she did not even notice Queen Camilla watching on from the front row of the Royal Box on Centre Court.\n\n\"Oh, wow, I didn't even see [her],\" Rybakina said after walking off court.\n\n\"That's amazing.\"\n\nRybakina meets Barbora Krejčíková in the semis after the Czech recorded a 6-4, 7-6 (7/4) win over Latvian 13th seed Jeļena Ostapenko in a clash of former French Open winners.\n\nAAP/Reuters\n\nTopic:NRL\n\nTopic:Paralympic Games\n\nTopic:Sport\n\nTopic:Police\n\nTopic:State of Origin\n\nTopic:Health\n\nAnalysis by Patricia Karvelas\n\nTopic:Foreign Aid\n\nTopic:Alternative Energy\n\nTopic:Courts\n\nTopic:Tennis\n\nTopic:Tennis\n\nEngland\n\nSport\n\nTennis\n\nTopic:Health\n\nAnalysis by Patricia Karvelas\n\nTopic:Foreign Aid\n\nTopic:Alternative Energy\n\nTopic:Courts\n\nTopic:World War 2\n\nTopic:Children's Health\n\nTopic:Activism and Lobbying\n\nTopic:Indigenous Culture\n\nWe acknowledge Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples as the First Australians and Traditional Custodians of the lands where we live, learn, and work.\n\nThis service may include material from Agence France-Presse (AFP), APTN, Reuters, AAP, CNN and the BBC World Service which is copyright and cannot be reproduced.\n\nAEST = Australian Eastern Standard Time which is 10 hours ahead of GMT (Greenwich Mean Time)"

Effective use of crystals “can accentuate the routine of the gymnasts, their line.”\n\nJordan Chiles, Suni Lee, Jade Carey and Hezly Rivera will compete alongside Biles, who will captain the five-person team. \n\nJoscelyn Roberson and Leanne Wong were named as alternates. \n\nAt the Tokyo Olympics in 2021, the American gymnasts, who took home the silver, wore leotards adorned with 6,400 crystals. \n\nIt’s safe to say they are definitely stepping up their game this year.\n\nThe 2024 Paris Olympics gymnastics events will begin July 27. \n\nAdvertisement"

Given that the rules and quotas are designed to ensure fairness and consistency for all participating NOCs, we are obligated to comply with these regulations without exception.”\n\nSidlauskas commented on the situation, stating that he’s “uncomfortable” swimming the relay as someone who only trains breaststroke.\n\n“This is a very unpleasant surprise,” he said. “Four swimmers trained all season, competed for a place in the team that should swim at the Olympics, and now they learned that one of them will not be able to do so, despite having earned the right.\n\n“It is sad for the young athletes who experienced such a blow even after becoming European champions. They were contenders for the Olympic final. This would have meant a lot for Lithuanian sports.\n\n“Now, hoping for any better result when three athletes swim freestyle and one trains only in breaststroke is simply naive and unprofessional. I am uncomfortable having to swim in a relay I am not\nrelated to.\n\n“Of course, I will do my best, but it is absurd because conditions should be the same for all participants. The saddest thing is that all of Lithuania’s hopes of achieving the best historical result in the relay are shattered even before the start.”\n\nRapsys commented” “It is sad that, having the strongest relay lineup in our swimming history, we will not be able to utilize it at the Olympic Games.\n\n“I saw with my own eyes how hard my teammates worked to showcase their abilities and to earn the right to compete at the Olympics. And now, despite having earned that right, we will not be able to reveal our full potential or achieve the best result. Is that the essence of the Olympic spirit?”\n\nThe head of LTU Aquatics, Saulius Binevičius, says they are considering the possibility of appealing to the Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS).\n\nHe said, “I have never encountered such a violation of sports principles.\n\n“Our team is deeply unsettled because we were prepared to achieve our highest goals at the Olympic Games.\n\n“The well-being of our athletes is critical, as it is clear that we will not be allowed to pursue those goals. Kristupas Trepočka, who’s progress recently increased dramatically and who became the European Junior Champion just a few days ago, had to be told that the Olympic doors are being slammed in his face this year. Can you imagine how he feels? We will appeal to all countries that have faced the same fate.”\n\n\n\nΔ\n\n\n\nΔ\n\nFree my boy Ohio star ⭐️ Navi\n\nso how many countries are in this event?\n\nHaving Olympic quotas at all is a bit of a farce with “sports” like breakdancing being included this year.\n\nWhat makes breakdancing not a sport, but explain it without referencing your age.\n\nChallenge level: impossible.\n\nWell it just doesn’t seem like it fits with the…atmosphere at the Olympics? \n\nI always thought of the Olympics being for more developed sports. \n\nAlso another problem is once you add niche things like breakdancing, why not add other types of dancing? It quickly gets overwhelming. \n\nI don’t see how age has anything to do with this, I imagine I’m on the younger side of swimswam commenters and I’m against breakdancing as a oly sport.\n\nEach host country / city have the option of recommending a few sports, some of those get to participate and might only be in the Olympics for 1 Olympic Game. Some of the sports in Paris might not every show up again and some might become permanent, in LA we will have flag football – a team sport. Adding a team sport risk reducing the quotas for other sports so swimming and Track might have fewer spots in LA than in Paris.\n\nParis should’ve added boules/bocce instead of breaking.\n\nWhether the rule is appropriate is one thing, but not knowing the rule is Lithuanian Swimming Association’s own fault. The qualification procedure was published about two years ago. It’s written clearly in it how many relay-only swimmers you could bring given the number of relays you qualify in. It’s not even a new rule. The same rule applies in Tokyo and in Rio (I didn’t know about earlier Olympics but I assume its history is much longer).\n\nRead the rule again, especially relay exceptionals part. Ir has been modified due to WC Doha, to encourage teams to come and compete for relay qualiffication. Much less teams would go there in February if not relay qualiffications. Relay exceptionals were added as ‘help’ for the teams not having enough athletes qualified. They just refused to give Lithuania relay exceptional. Argument – OQT breaststroke. If no brastroke OQT’s, Lithuania would have the realy exceptional place. They (we) were punished for having strong breaststroker. I wonder if he will swim freestyle or brestroke in Olympics.\n\nWhat’s the point of inviting Top 16 relay teams if they can’t select their best team.\n\nOh come on! U have more than a year to showcase your ability to beat OQT, but fail to do so. And now you blame the rule?? Insane\n\nTurkye and Slovenia girls also. But they got relay exceptionals.\n\nThink exceptions are given if you do not have swimmers with individual invites.\n\nYou are 100% right. WA could tell this in Fukuoka. Lithuania already had 2 OQTs there. Despite this, they communicated that the decision would depend on available quotas. WA actions contradict their statements about having no flexibility on this (quotas for Turkye and Slovenia) and the purpose of exceptional quotas. They kept the decision for the last day, despite 2 and later 3 OQTs reached by Lithuania.\n\nchampions of europe make it make sense.\n\nThe writing is on the wall: 2028 it will be 24 roster cap.\n\nIt is a shame that some of the pillars of olympic competition like swimming, weightlifting, gymnastics, athletics and others are losing spots to some of the incredibly dumb sports they have added and continue to add. \n\n3 on 3 basketball? This would be the equivalent of adding ice swimming\n\nSoon swimming will be in the same boat as weightlifting where some of the dominant nations leave gold medal contenders at home because they can only send 3 athletes across 6 categories.\n\nCouldn’t agree more. I think the IOC keeps adding ridiculous sports as a way to make the Olympics more appealing to certain niche groups of people. Bit imo it just makes the Olympics seem more gimmicky and takes away from the main Olympic sports\n\nFormer Masters swimmer and coach Loretta (Retta) thrives on a non-stop but productive schedule.

There was no signs of any fatigue, any problems beforehand, it just happened on a freak movement.\"\n\nThere is a cruel irony in de Minaur's brilliant movement on the court being his undoing, heightened by his warnings a couple of days before his withdrawal.\n\nFor all the latest on and off the court, join Lauren Bordin, John Millman and John Alexander for the ABC Tennis Podcast on ABC listen.\n\nDe Minaur barely celebrated his win over Fils, limping around the court to acknowledge the fans before sitting in his chair and looking up at his box with concern.\n\nIn the immediate aftermath, he tried to play it off as a \"jarred\" hip and said he was feeling a bit \"ginger\", but it was more of a scare than anything else.\n\nWe now know he was smiling through the pain and desperately hoping the power of positive thinking might give way to \"some sort of miracle\", but he knew the dangers of a \"freak movement\" that caused his injury.\n\nDe Minaur said he had to generate \"an excessive amount of force\" on that match point and went into detail on the unique nature of movement on grass courts.\n\nNovak Djokovic's flexibility, when paired with his speed and stamina, makes him able to move in ways other can't. (Getty Images: Julian Finney)\n\nPeople have always slid on clay courts — often there are no other options to stop if a player is moving at any sort of pace — but now it's an all-surface activity.\n\nThere were others like Kim Clijsters and Gael Monfils who semi-regularly ended up doing the splits after stretching to reach a ball, but Djokovic was on another level.\n\nOf course, he still is, but since he emerged on the court with his ability to run at pace, slide, get low and hit groundstrokes off both wings, more and more players have followed.\n\n\"A lot of us players, including myself, are getting a lot more confidence on a grass court with being able to slide and back your movement in that way,\" de Minaur said after his fourth-round win, before ominously going on.\n\nThe grass court shoes are designed to have more grip to help push off the slicker surface without looking like Bambi on ice, but that means players have to generate much more force when they do want to slide and that comes with risk.\n\n\"We've got to commit to the slide, which you do on a hard court as well,\" de Minaur went on.\n\n\"Once you get through that scare factor that you're going to roll an ankle or something like that, and just trust that you've got enough momentum to slide, it's a game-changer on grass.\n\nThe shoes worn by players on grass courts have extra grip, making sliding a more physical process. (Getty Images: Clive Brunskill)\n\n\"Because any extra inch you can get movement-wise on grass, it's definitely a big advantage over your opponents.\"\n\nIt's not just about getting there and hopefully getting the ball back over the net; players are mid-slide, ripping forehand and backhand with top spin.\n\nIt strains every muscle in the body, and all that torque and tension has to go somewhere. In this case, it focused acutely on the fibrocartilage where de Minaur's adductor attaches to his abs.\n\nIt ended what should have been the biggest moment of his career before it even started, with the risk too high of turning a potential month-long injury lay-off into a season-ender to justify stepping on court with the ruthless Djokovic.\n\nABC Sport Daily is your daily sports conversation. We dive into the biggest story of the day and get you up to speed with everything else that's making headlines.\n\nEven if de Minaur makes a full physical recovery, if this injury brings back any of the hesitance he spoke about, he will be robbed of one of his greatest defensive and offensive weapons: his ability to get balls back from anywhere, with interest.\n\nThe 25-year-old is set to jump to a career-high sixth in the world after his second straight trip to the last eight at a major, both coming on polar opposite surfaces — the red clay of Roland Garros and the green grass of SW19.\n\nBut he has not been sleeping and, rather than playing the biggest match of his career, his week ended on the brink of tears in a press conference room, slumped in front of microphones.\n\n\"I haven't really been able to enjoy what I've achieved this week,\" he said.\n\nSome day he surely will. And hopefully, he can have more weeks like this with decidedly different endings.\n\nTopic:NRL\n\nTopic:Paralympic Games\n\nTopic:Sport\n\nTopic:Police\n\nTopic:State of Origin\n\nTopic:Health\n\nAnalysis by Patricia Karvelas\n\nTopic:Foreign Aid\n\nTopic:Alternative Energy\n\nTopic:Courts\n\nTopic:Tennis\n\nTopic:Tennis\n\nAustralia\n\nEngland\n\nSport\n\nTennis\n\nTopic:Health\n\nAnalysis by Patricia Karvelas\n\nTopic:Foreign Aid\n\nTopic:Alternative Energy\n\nTopic:Courts\n\nTopic:World War 2\n\nTopic:Children's Health\n\nTopic:Activism and Lobbying\n\nTopic:Indigenous Culture\n\nWe acknowledge Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples as the First Australians and Traditional Custodians of the lands where we live, learn, and work.\n\nThis service may include material from Agence France-Presse (AFP), APTN, Reuters, AAP, CNN and the BBC World Service which is copyright and cannot be reproduced.\n\nAEST = Australian Eastern Standard Time which is 10 hours ahead of GMT (Greenwich Mean Time)"

It was Canada’s most significant international medal since winning silver at the 1936 Berlin Olympics.\n\nThe four players on the Olympic team that weren’t part of the World Cup: Jamal Murray, Khem Birch, Trey Lyles and Andrew Nembhard.\n\n“Leading our Senior Men’s National Team into the Paris 2024 Olympic Games is an incredible honor,” Olynyk said. “Since I began playing basketball, my dream has always been to represent Canada at the Olympics. Last year’s third-place finish at the FIBA World Cup was an important step, proving that we belong among the world’s best teams. However, it also showed us that we still have work to do as we pursue our ultimate goal of winning gold in Paris.”\n\nThe team opens its exhibition schedule Wednesday in Las Vegas against the United States.\n\nGilgeous-Alexander is now a second-generation Olympian; his mother, Charmaine Gilgeous, ran for Antigua and Barbuda in the 1992 Barcelona Games. Same goes for Barrett; his father, Rowan Barrett, was on the 2000 Olympic team for Canada and serves as the general manager for Canada’s men’s national team. And for Ejim, it’s a sibling thing; his sister, Yvonne Ejim, will play in France this summer as part of the Canadian women’s basketball roster.\n\n\n\n\n“Representing your country at an Olympic Games is one of the greatest honors in sport and something each of these players will never forget the first time they step onto the court,” Rowan Barrett said. “As we build on our success last summer, maintaining the continuity and cohesion we established with that team was vital to assembling this Olympic roster.”\n\nThe team is coached by Jordi Fernandez of the Brooklyn Nets.\n\n“When we opened camp in Toronto last week, I challenged each of the players to improve 1% each day, and every day since I’ve witnessed the work and dedication they have put in,” Fernández said. “With 17 days to go until our first game of the tournament, that’s an opportunity to get 17% better. From the players to the coaches to the staff, the incredible opportunity ahead of us to do something truly historic for Canada this summer is not lost on anyone.”\n\n___\n\nAP Summer Olympics: https://apnews.com/hub/2024-paris-olympic-games\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCopyright 2025 The Associated Press.

        "expanded content": "LAS VEGAS – There was a sequence Monday during Team USA’s second and final scrimmage against the USA Select Team that highlights the many valuable lessons Trayce Jackson-Davis can take back home to San Francisco. \n\nThe second-year Warriors center set a high screen on Steph Curry above the 3-point line for USA Select teammate Jaime Jaquez Jr., rolled to the basket and the lefty finished with his off-hand over Joel Embiid. Jackson-Davis then sank deep into the paint on defense because of LeBron James’ driving ability, leaving Embiid open at the top of the arc. \n\nAnd just like that, Jackson-Davis recovered a split second too late. \n\nWith our All Access Daily newsletter, stay in the game with the latest updates on your beloved Bay Area and California sports teams!\n\nHis hand went up, but Embiid wasn’t bothered thanks to receiving ample space and drilled a three on Jackson-Davis. A teaching moment that surely was reviewed from film later that same day. \n\n“This is as good as it gets,” Warriors coach Steve Kerr, who currently is coaching Team USA one last time, told NBC Sports Bay Area. \n\nEarlier in the scrimmage, Jackson-Davis began to set a screen for Brandon Miller on his left side near half court, adjusted his body to the right, rolled and came down with a high pass over Embiid. The Warriors’ steal of a second-round pick a year ago then settled, jumped off two feet and was fouled by Anthony Edwards on his way back up. \n\nThe same scrimmage also featured Jackson-Davis getting backed down all the way to the hoop by Embiid before the 2022-23 NBA MVP made a twisting layup over him, and Jackson-Davis lost Curry on a backdoor cut but was lucky enough to see Steph miss his reverse layup attempt. \n\nFind the latest Golden State Warriors news, highlights, analysis and more with NBC Sports Bay Area and California.\n\nAnother mental note, another lesson to be learned. \n\nFinding the value in the highs and lows was evident throughout the day. The hustle and agility of Golden State’s late-season starting center who forced Kevon Looney to the bench also made Jayson Tatum kick the ball out when Jackson-Davis swiped down at Tatum exposing the ball down low. \n\nBut Jackson-Davis’ best play Monday might have been at the hands of a missed shot.\n\nAfter guarding Curry at the 3-point line and using his length to make him hand the ball over to Anthony Edwards, Jackson-Davis sprinted back to the other side off a miss from the Minnesota Timberwolves star and noticed a mismatch of Curry having to defend him in the post. Jackson-Davis took one strong dribble that made Edwards leave Brandon Miller wide open in the left corner. \n\nThat’s when Jackson-Davis found Miller without hesitation, but the No. 2 pick in the 2023 NBA Draft clanked the corner three. The result didn’t matter. It was Warriors basketball on UNLV’s practice court. \n\n“I just think my feel,” Jackson-Davis says when I asked where his game has grown the most from the start of his rookie year. “I kind of grew up a little bit this year. Started the year in the G League and then getting a few playing time here and there, spot minutes, and then starting at the end of the year – I just feel like my growth, I just need to keep improving on that, keep improving on what I need to do as a player to get my guys open shots and then finish.” \n\nSunday’s first scrimmage had to feature more nerves and butterflies for the young Select Team. Flashes of Jackson-Davis having success on some of the game's biggest and best giants like Davis and Bam Adebayo was hard to miss. So was them asserting their will on Jackson-Davis, too.\n\nThe invaluable lessons have stacked up day by day. \n\nEmbiid didn’t specifically mention any one Select Team player who has stood out to him, but after a day of battling Jackson-Davis, he made it a point of emphasize how they’ve prepared them for the 2024 Paris Summer Olympics. \n\n“They’ve given us a challenge,” Embiid said. “It’s pretty good for us. They play hard, they play fast. They run a lot of actions we might see, especially at the level of some of those Olympic teams. They’ve done a great job.” \n\nA storied four-year college career at Indiana wasn’t enough for Jackson-Davis to be a top draft pick. His first NBA start didn’t come until the Warriors’ final game of the 2023 calendar year, one in which he dropped 17 points on 8-of-11 shooting against the Dallas Mavericks. \n\nNow a little over a year after sliding to the second-round of the draft, Jackson-Davis and his rookie class Warriors teammate Brandin Podziemski find themselves in a similar situation that started Curry’s road to stardom. \n\n“I wasn't on the Select Team, but my rookie year I was on the 2010 World Championship team,” Curry said. “You get to kind of expand your game, get tested a little bit, work on some stuff and make the most of the summers. It's kind of cool to see them going through that same kind of process.”\n\nEach step of Jackson-Davis’ journey has seen him flourish given bigger opportunities. Brick by brick, step by step, the big man sporting a fresh buzz cut and tightly shaved chin hair knows he’s coming out the other side better after battling the likes of Embiid, Davis, Adebayo and others for two straight scrimmages. \n\n“At the end of the day, being out on the court with these dudes was a blessing,” Jackson-Davis said.\n\nDownload and follow the Dubs Talk Podcast"

Justin Brownlee (32) and Kai Sotto (11) in action for Gilas Pilipinas in the 2024 FIBA Asia Cup Qualifiers.\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\tFIBA\t\t\t\t\t\n\nMANILA, Philippines –  For three nights on the first week of July, Filipino basketball fans cheered on Gilas Pilipinas who went toe-to-toe with some of the top teams in the world in the FIBA Paris Olympic Qualifying Tournament held in Riga, Latvia.\n\nThose three nights allowed Filipinos to hope for something that previously seemed unreachable – the right to be one of the 12 teams in the Paris Olympics.\n\nFor some, hope was the point of it all, a glimmer that people could hold on to that rekindled their love and passion for the national team, a flicker that showed that the Philippines could be competitive against the world’s best.\n\nFor coach Tim Cone, however, the campaign in Riga was a mission unaccomplished. The goal was not merely to show that Gilas Pilipinas could keep in step with competition.\n\nThe prize was never just the journey nor the learning experience. The prize was to win it all and make it to Paris. Cone regarded “almost winning” for what it truly is – a loss.\n\nThat kind of mentality, perhaps, is the game changer that allowed Gilas Pilipinas to go as far as it did in the qualifiers.\n\nWhereas before, the objective when facing world class teams was not to get blown off the court or keep the score close, then try to steal a win in the end. This time around, Gilas Pilipinas came out throwing haymakers with an eye on knocking down their foes.\n\nThe desire to win had always been there even for previous iterations of Gilas Pilipinas. This was true for the Yeng Guiao-mentored squad in the 2019 World Cup even as they lost all five games by an average of 29.4 points.\n\nThis was also true when Chot Reyes handled the team that could win only once in five games despite the support of the home crowd in the 2023 FIBA World Cup.\n\nThe difference this time around is that aside from the desire to win, Cone has been able to instill in this current Gilas Pilipinas the belief that it could actually win.\n\nAfter Cone steered Gilas Pilipinas to an unexpected gold in the Asian Games last year, the first time the country bagged the top plum since 1962, the logical next step would have been to attempt to regain Asian basketball supremacy by winning the 2025 FIBA Asia Cup in Saudi Arabia.\n\nIt was a prudent objective for Gilas, one that would still require a ton of effort considering how the team has fared against Asian rivals in the last 10 years.\n\nSince 2015, the Philippines has lost its head-to-head battles against South Korea (2 wins, 6 losses), Lebanon (2 wins, 5 losses), and Jordan (4 wins, 6 losses).\n\nThe only teams that Gilas has consistently defeated are fading Asian giants Iran (5 wins, 4 losses) and China (4 wins, 3 losses). Gilas also has a 6-1 record against emerging Asian power Japan, but Japan won the last encounter in 2022 by 21 points.\n\nThere was always a sense of foreboding in the past every time Gilas Pilipinas faced Australia or New Zealand. There was a quiet resignation that they were bigger, more organized, more athletic, and did everything better than Gilas Pilipinas.\n\nAustralia had beaten the Philippines by an average of 24.6 points in three matches in the last 10 years. Since 2013, New Zealand has prevailed over the Philippines five times by an average winning margin of 19.6 points.\n\nIt is no longer unreasonable to actually aim to defeat the Boomers and the Tall Blacks. This proposition will be tested on November 21 when Gilas Pilipinas faces New Zealand in the FIBA Asia Cup qualification. It will not be easy, but it can be done.\n\nIt is also no longer foolish to dream even bigger.\n\nQualifying anew for the 2027 FIBA World Cup in Qatar. Earning a berth in the 2028 Los Angeles Olympics. Not just making up the numbers in these competitions but actually becoming a legitimate threat that could beat even the best of them.\n\nThe blueprint was already laid out in Riga, especially when Gilas Pilipinas stunned world No. 6 and host Latvia, 89-80, before their home fans.\n\nIt was a monumental upset against a team that placed fifth in the 2023 FIBA World Cup, only missing out on the semifinals after a heartbreaking 79-81 loss in the quarterfinals to eventual champion Germany.\n\nIt was the first win in 64 years by the Philippines over a European team in a FIBA event. From 2014 to 2023, the Philippines had lost 18 straight games to national teams from Europe.\n\nThe last time the Philippines chalked up a win over a Euro side was when the RP Selecta team tripped Ukraine, 100-98, in a three-day pocket tournament held in Sondrio, Italy, in June 2002, when Kai Sotto, born on May 11, 2002, was not even a month old yet. Carl Tamayo and Kevin Quiambao were just over a year old.\n\nBut it is imperative to remain grounded and continue to strengthen the program. After all, to put things in the proper perspective, counting the tuneup games that Gilas Pilipinas played as they prepared for the OQT, the team won just twice in six games.\n\nThree of those losses came against European teams, including the two-point defeat to Georgia. The last was against eventual OQT winner and world No. 12 Brazil in a match where the Philippines led by six points at the half.\n\nIt was in that last loss that valuable lessons surfaced.\n\nOne is the need for the team to have more depth. Sotto’s absence in the knockout semis versus Brazil took a heavy toll on Cone’s frontline rotation.\n\nAJ Edu will be a welcome addition. But other than Edu, one wonders who else is in the horizon, given that Japeth Aguilar is already 37 and Mason Amos has not gained Cone’s trust yet.\n\nA healthy Scottie Thompson taking turns running the backcourt with Chris Newsome, Dwight Ramos, and CJ Perez will be a luxury that Cone would be only too happy to have.\n\nGilas Pilipinas did shoot an impressive 46.8% clip from the three-point region in the three games in the Olympic qualifiers.\n\nAdding a shooter or two to the pool will never be a bad idea. Jordan Heading is a solid option. So is Matthew Wright who was the most prolific Filipino last season in the Japan B. League, converting 2.4 triples per game.\n\nThe right program is in place, and all indications suggest that this will be sustained. The right coach is at the helm, one who understands the amount of work that still needs to be done.\n\nThe world now has taken notice of Gilas Pilipinas. But it takes more than just the right mindset and team culture to become a significant force in the global stage.\n\nGilas is not there yet, but it is on the right track to get there eventually. – Rappler.com\n\nHow does this make you feel?\n\nfollow us\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

I learned of responsibility and learned from the experience.\n\n“I also learned from failure ad have continued to learn. And now, I want to put what I’ve learnt to the test.\n\n“I’ve finally learnt the true meaning of perseverance and determination.”\n\nThe 13 seeds in the men’s singles will be placed in 13 groups where the champions will head to the last 16 stage.\n\nIt’s different in the doubles as only four pairs will be seeded.\n\nMen’s doubles pair Aaron Chia-Soh Wooi Yik have retained their position at world No. 5 and will not be seeded but it is unlikely to give them a major headache.\n\nThe top four seeds are world No. 1 Liang Weikeng-Wang Chang of China, Denmark’s Kim Astrup-Anders Skaarup Rasmussen (No. 2), Satwiksairaj Rankireddy-Chirag Shetty of India (No. 3) and South Korean world champions Kang Min-hyuk-Seo Seung-jae (No. 4).\n\nThe 16 qualifiers for the doubles events will be divided into four groups where Aaron-Wooi Yik should be with one of the four seeds.\n\nThe Malaysians should secure a top two spot in their group to advance to the quarter-finals.\n\nHowever, world No. 13 Pearly Tan-M. Thinaah may have a seeded pair and also a top eight pair in their group which will make it tougher for them to advance to the knock-out stage.\n\nThe same goes to mixed doubles Chen Tang Jie-Toh Ee Wei who could also be grouped with two top eight pairs.\n\nIn the women’s singles, world No. 32 Goh Jin Wei may also face early trouble as she could be placed in the same group as one of the top eight seeds.\n\nThank you for your report!\n\nCopyright © 1995-\n            \n\n Star Media Group Berhad [197101000523 (10894-D)]\n\nBest viewed on Chrome browsers.\n\n\n\nWe would love to keep you posted on the latest promotion.

After Jannik Sinner’s defeat by Daniil Medvedev, the Italian flags on Centre Court were soon fluttering again as Jasmine Paolini defeated Emma Navarro 6-1, 6-2 to become the first Italian woman to reach a Wimbledon semi-final. Not bad for a 28-year-old who, until this year, had not won a single tour match on grass.\n\nThis was the first time in four attempts Paolini had made it past the first round at this tournament. She had lost to the American every time they had played before – three times in the past nine months.\n\n“Mentally it was tough to play against her,” said Paolini, who will face Donna Vekic in the semi-final after the Croatian beat Lulu Sun. “I love the way she plays. The last three matches I was really struggling with her. I was repeating to myself that it’s a different match, different surface, so to try to be aggressive. I think I played a really, really good match.”\n\nIf the Sinner-Medvedev match was a David Lean epic, this was a Pixar short. Paolini raced to the first set in under half an hour, and finished the job 30 minutes later. Her American opponent held her serve only twice in the match, while Paolini commanded the stage, and in particular the net, where she won 16 points and lost only one.\n\nBoth women arrived on the back of grand slam personal bests in last month’s French Open, but Paolini is in the form of her life. In Dubai in February she won only the second singles title of her career. Last month she reached her first ever grand slam final at Roland Garros, before taking another runners-up trophy in the women’s doubles.\n\nHer doubles work was in strong evidence here with nifty work around the court. For someone giving away three inches to her opponent, she seemed to have enormous reach. She hit 19 winners to Navarro’s six and no rally lasted longer than the 15-shot one that began the match.\n\nCuriously, this was Paolini’s second game against an American billionaire heiress in as many days. On Monday, she and her partner, Sara Errani, lost to Jessica Pegula and Coco Gauff in the fourth round of the women’s doubles. Pegula is the only tennis player worth more than Navarro, whose father owns not only the bank that sponsors her kit but also her home town tournament, the Charleston Open.\n\nNavarro grew up in the South Carolinian city, whose antebellum charm is riddled with horrible histories, and which remains a place of fine living for the ultra-wealthy. Her father, Ben, whose financial firm specialises in credit cards and debt collection, has bought large chunks of it, including the 11,000-seater stadium where his daughter made her WTA debut in 2019. Tennis has always been a rich person’s sport, but these may be its nepo baby years.\n\nNavarro is proving her credentials nevertheless. The 23-year-old won the first tour title of her career at Hobart in January, and reached the fourth round of the French Open last month. Having started the 2023 ranked 149th, she came into this match No 17; her run here will take her to a new career high.\n\nThis match was full of brisk intent from the outset. Both women hustled between points, Navarro snatching at the balls as they were fed to her. The American took the first break at 1-1, pouncing on Paolini’s second serve and slamming home a fierce forehand.\n\nBut Paolini broke her next game to love, and soon the Italian’s unrelenting pace seemed to rattle Navarro, whose shots grew increasingly hurried and harassed. She lost four games in a row, and her backhand was running wild.\n\nShe fought to regain composure in the second set, and showed a couple of flashes of fire. A flutter of errors, including a backhand volley taken too early, suggested Paolini might be getting over-eager, and there might have been a way back in for Navarro at 3-1, when Paolini hit long at 30-30.\n\nBut Navarro lost the fourth of the five break points she had in this match. From then on, Paolini jammed a heavy foot on the accelerator and Navarro won only two more points in the match. It was very different from her dominant display in her fourth-round win over Gauff, with whom she is due to play doubles at the Paris Olympics next month.\n\n“I just faced a really, really tough opponent today that played lights out and didn’t give me anything” an admiring Navarro said of Paolini. “She was a totally different player today … she was on top of me from the very first point.”"

        "expanded content": "\nThe                 NBA\n\n is the world’s premier basketball league, where the game’s greatest players compete at the highest level of competition. But FIBA is the governing body that rules over the international style of play for the game of basketball. This summer, the two will clash when NBA players head overseas to Paris, France to partake in the 2024 Summer                 Olympics\n\n.    \n\nThere, FIBA will have full control of the games, their rules, style, and overall format. While the game of basketball is fundamentally similar, FIBA possesses a few major rule differences from the NBA.\n\nTherefore, the game will be slightly different during the Olympics than it is during a typical NBA season. Here are a few of the basic rule differences you need to know before watching the NBA’s biggest stars take to the international stage at the Olympic Games this summer.\n\n On the surface, FIBA possesses a few different rules that will be noticeable to any NBA fan right off the bat. The game is played in four quarters of ten minutes each, as opposed to the NBA’s format of four quarters that are twelve minutes each. Games, therefore, are a total of 40 minutes in FIBA.\n\nThe three-point line in FIBA is a bit closer to the basket than in the NBA — 6.75 meters (22.1 feet) in FIBA as opposed to 7.24 meters (23.7 feet) in the NBA.\n\nFouls are also different. In the NBA, a player fouls out after committing either six fouls or two technical fouls. In FIBA, a player fouls out after committing a total of five fouls of any kind. In the NBA, play resumes at the point of a technical foul following free throws, but in FIBA, the player is awarded one free throw after a technical, and possession is returned to center court.\n\nDespite the ball appearing different, the NBA and FIBA actually use the same sized ball. The FIBA ball simply has a different look, as it consists of 12 panels in brighter colors, as opposed to the NBA's ball which features eight panels in primarily the same color. Both balls feature a 29.5-inch circumference.\n\n FIBA possesses different rules during play as well. Perhaps the biggest difference is in goaltending: in the NBA, a player cannot block a shot that is in a downward trajectory toward the basket, otherwise, it counts as goaltending and the subsequent points are awarded.\n\nThis also applies to FIBA; however, defenders are allowed to swat the ball away if it touches the rim. Once the ball has made contact with the rim, an offensive player can push the ball into the goal — this is not allowed in the NBA.\n\nFIBA also lacks restriction in the paint. In FIBA, players can remain in the lane for as long as they want, hogging the paint and therefore making it harder for players to score at the rim. This is a huge contrast to the NBA, where players cannot remain in the paint for longer than three seconds.\n\nBoth of these rule differences give the edge in play to big men, prioritizing their play. It also puts a greater emphasis on defense, something that the NBA has arguably been lacking in recent years.\n\nFIBA’s rules ensure that the level of competitive play is balanced across the board, as it is undeniable that NBA players possess a huge advantage over other global players who are not in the NBA.\n\nGiannis Antetokounmpo's performance in Greece's group B win over the Dominican Republic has Greece looking like Olympic threats to Team USA.\n\nWe want to hear from you! Share your opinions in the thread below and remember to keep it respectful.\n\nYour comment has not been saved\n\nThis thread is open for discussion.\n\nBe the first to post your thoughts.\n\n\n\nThe salaries for the biggest earnings in the NBA for the 2024/2025 season have been revealed.\n\nThe National Basketball Association has seen dozens of stellar players over the years, but which 10 players have been the absolute best?\n\nJames owns a 2% stake in the football club.\n\nWhen he was asked about the toughest opponent of his NBA career, Michael Jordan didn't need time to think.\n\nMichael Jordan made a fair few enemies during his illustrious NBA career, but one man stood out more than most when it came to hatred.\n\nSome of the greatest players in basketball have played at the small forward position."

I've spoken to a few girls in the team and they are feeling the same way I am, that it's just a really tight selection.\n\n\"I don't know how it was communicated, but no matter how it was, it's going to be tough news for someone who probably, and rightly so, assumed she was going to be in.\n\nKatrina Powell during the announcement of the Hockeyroos squad.  Getty\n\n\"Something needed to be changed and Katrina Powell, who was a prolific goalscorer herself, didn't see a goalscorer in Rosie and one goal in 15 games is that reason ... it's not something that Rosie would have wanted to hear. \n\n\"She is probably a bit stiff, I would have had her in my team, but I don't think it's as big of a shock as it appears on paper.\"\n\nMalone has scored 33 goals in 114 appearances for the Hockeyroos since making her international debut in 2018, but her long-time exploits in the green and gold weren't enough for Powell to grant the Queensland product selection for the Olympics.\n\nParker also pointed out the IHF award that Malone was shortlisted for in 2023 lacks the same prestige it did in years gone by.\n\n\"That is a strange award nowadays and basically, if you're really gonna have the top five players in the world, they would all be from Holland,\" she said\n\n\"It's maybe not as prestigious of an award as it once was. I was slightly surprised she was nominated for this award to begin with, she's a good player of course, but top five in the world for probably any of our players is surprising.\n\n\"It does look worse on paper she was left out… but t's a tough non-selection.\"\n\nMalone's social media post, which addressed her confusion over the selection snub, received an outpouring of support from fans and fellow athletes.\n\nRosie Malone couldn't hold back tears in an Instagram video.  Instagram\n\nParker hopes that Malone receives support from those within her own inner circle, but also sympathised with the Aussie players who earned selection in front of her.\n\n\"She's a very good social media user and she's somebody who has got a lot of attention on her ... she's getting a lot of support,\" Parker said.\n\n\"She gives a great insight into it and it's going to be a really tough month for her and I hope she is getting the support she deserves, because she will have to turn up and train with a team that she thinks that she should be in.\n\n\"I had the same kind of feelings before the London Olympics and having to train alongside them when you think that you should be in the side.\n\nGeorgie Parker in action for Hockeyroos during the 2016 Rio Olympics.  Getty\n\n\"It's a really tough time for her, but also for the girls on the other side who will be sitting there knowing that they are in this side instead of Rosie and eyes are now going to be on them. It's tough for the whole squad and it's just a really hard thing to go through. \n\n\"It's the really tough nature of sport and the hard, ugly side of sport, and Rosie is very good at showing an insight into that.\"\n\nParker played over 200 games for the national side during her career, competing at the Olympics and winning a gold medal at the 2014 Commonwealth Games in Glasgow.\n\n9 minutes ago\n\n37 minutes ago\n\n1 hour ago\n\n© 2025 Nine Entertainment Co."

        "expanded content": "Despite pocketing a cool £226,000 from her recent Wimbledon stint, Emma Raducanu is set to take a financial hit.\n\nThe 21-year-old tennis star faced off against last-minute replacement Renata Zarazua in the tournament's opening game, besting the Mexican player with scores of 7-6 and 6-3 to secure her spot in the second round. She then breezed past Elise Mertens with 6-1 and 6-2 victories, advancing to the third round where she made short work of Maria Sakkari, winning 6-2 and 6-3.\n\nHowever, the British tennis sensation's journey came to an abrupt end in the round of 16 when she was pitted against New Zealand's Lulu Sun. Sun took the first game 6-2, but Raducanu fought back to win the second 7-5.\n\nSadly, this would be her last victory at Wimbledon 2024, as Sun once again triumphed 6-2 in the third set, knocking Raducanu out of the competition. Even though she was eliminated in the round of 16, the star reportedly walked away with a £226,000 paycheck for her participation in the London-based Grand Slam.\n\nHowever, financial experts predict that she'll face significant financial fees off the court. Dr Rob Wilson, speaking to OLBG, explained: \"Emma Raducanu, like most athletes who earn any kind of real money, will be set up as a company for the purposes of taxation and earning profits etc.\n\n\"She'll pay, on the basis that she's based in the UK, 20% corporation tax up to a certain level and then 25% as soon as those profits go above the next tax threshold. So if she were to earn, say, £10million she would be expected to be taxed by around £2.5m, and then there will be deductible expenses through a company to try and bring that tax bill down, which are all legitimate.\n\n\"But she will have a significant tax bill based upon her Wimbledon earnings which are as of yet to be confirmed. Realistically, 20% corporation tax on top of those earnings.\" It follows accusations that Raducanu spoiled tennis legend Andy Murray's Wimbledon farewell in the mixed doubles tournament.\n\nInitially, Murray was set to participate in the men's singles tournament, but he couldn't make his first match with Tomas Machac due to recovery from a back operation. Instead, Murray chose to compete in the men's doubles and mixed doubles tournaments. In the men's doubles, he and his brother Jamie were defeated in their first game against John Peers and Rinky Hijikata - losing 7-6 and 6-4.\n\nAnd Murray was also slated to play alongside Raducanu in the mixed doubles tournament until she withdrew due to injury concerns. Discussing the decision, she said: \"I didn’t want to take his last match away from him. But at the end of the day I think a lot of the players in a similar situation would have done the same thing, prioritising their body.\n\n\"I still stand by making the right call. He was obviously disappointed because it’s his last match [at Wimbledon]. But what a champion. I think that hopefully he’ll play in the Olympics and have another farewell there. I think with every decision, people are entitled to their opinions.\n\n\"Of course, there was a bit of a cloud it. I don’t think I would have done it any other way. I think in this sport especially, as an individual, you have to make your own calls and prioritise yourself. Especially with my history, I just had to put myself first.\" Two-time Wimbledon champ Murray is set to hang up his racket later this year, but not before aiming for Olympic gold with Team GB in Paris.\n\nAt Reach and across our entities we and our partners use information collected through cookies and other identifiers from your device to improve experience on our site, analyse how it is used and to show personalised advertising.

More info\n\nAn eight-lane running track at Munster Technological University (MTU) has been officially reopened after months of resurfacing works - giving a much-needed facility back to Leeside athletes.\n\n The athletics track at  the MTU Arena in Bishopstown, which was built in 1979, was reopened today following a total overhaul. The eight-lane track is now up to international standard - and is ready to welcome local, national and global athletes. \n\n It's welcome news for runners in Cork. In March, University College Cork's Sonia O'Sullivan Mardyke track was also closed over health and safety concerns due to \"significant\" deterioration - leaving athletics clubs across Leeside searching for a 'lifeline.'\n\n Read more: Cork City Cllrs clash over motion to remove prayers and crucifix from meetings \n\n Read more: Cork Airport to get more flights as Dublin remains capped \n\nThe MTU track has reopened just in time for the 70th Cork City Sports event on Tuesday, July 9. The MTU stadium has the capacity for more than 1,080 spectators.\n\nMTU President, Professor Maggie Cusack, welcomed the reopening of the important track: “Following a number of delays, including record bad weather last July and August, it’s wonderful to see the track reopen for the benefit of everyone from local sports clubs to athletes preparing for the Paris Olympics.\n\n\"This is a very special day for athletics in general but also for MTU and the wider community.”\n\nThe improvements to the athletics track were funded through the Department of Tourism, Culture, Arts, Gaeltacht, Sport and Media’s Large-Scale Sport Infrastructure Fund, with these works marking the completion of phase 2.\n\nPhase 1 saw the completion of the MTU Sports Arena last year, while phase 3 is expected to see the development of a high-performance indoor athletics training centre, which will involve an approximate 5,000m² expansion of the MTU Arena.\n\nThe track was officially reopened by Thomas Byrne T.D., Minister of State for Sport, Physical Education and the Gaeltacht.\n\nAlso in attendance were CEO of Athletics Ireland, Hamish Adams; President of MTU, Professor Maggie Cusack; MTU Vice President Finance & Operations, Paul Gallagher; Chair of MTU Governing Body, Jimmy Deenihan, and President of MTU Students’ Union Cork, Richard Noonan.\n\nClick this link to receive your daily dose of breaking CorkBeo content - straight to your WhatsApp messenger!\n\nWe also treat our community members to special offers, promotions, and adverts from us and our partners. \n\nIf you don’t like our community, you can check out any time you like.

        "expanded content": "No matter your sport, it can be hard to tune into every game, especially if you've given up cable. Fortunately, some of the best sports streaming services can help you start watching your favorite teams today, although it's not always easy to figure out which app you need.\n\nWhether you're into football, basketball, baseball, hockey, soccer, boxing, or something else entirely, we've combed through some of the most popular sports streaming services and identified the very best of the bunch. Our highlights range from three live TV packages that serve as wide-spanning cable alternatives to seven cheaper options that focus on one specific channel or a handful of popular sports. Even if you have cable, some streaming services have exclusive rights to games, so you might still need to sign up for an app to ensure full coverage.\n\nKeeping in mind a variety of budgets and sports, we've scoured the top streaming services to identify some of the best options for live streaming sports. For each service, we've outlined basic specs, including starting prices, relevant free trial information, and any notable missing channels. Plus, we've highlighted a few add-ons that sports fans might find helpful.\n\nDirectly below, you can find a cheat sheet of which leagues and sports have (select) coverage on each streaming service, although you should consult each app's exact channel lineups in our guide to see which (if not all) games you can stream. These are just some of the most popular sporting events available on each service, but most apps have some additional hidden gems. If you're interested in learning more about the ongoing sports streaming debacles, you can scroll down to our FAQ.\n\n\n                          Previously known as AT&T TV, DirecTV offers streaming access to a large selection of live channels, including most key networks typically found in traditional cable packages.\n                        \n\nSpecifics\n\nIf you're looking for something just like cable but don't want to lock into a contract or have any hardware, DirecTV is a great option. Signature plans start at $84.99 a month and feature more than 90 channels — including ESPN, TNT, and local networks — in the base Entertainment subscription. A helpful thing about DirecTV is that you can get almost every cable channel with an upgrade or add-on, but this also means that it can quickly become one of the priciest live TV streaming packages out there.\n\nDirecTV's new MySports package makes watching sports even cheaper. The plan, which costs $69.99 a month, carries 25+ key sports networks, including several popular cable channels typically only found in the higher tiers of DirecTV's signature packages. It also includes access to ESPN+. The only catch comes with the local channels. FOX and NBC are pretty broadly available, but ABC varies by region and CBS isn't included in the package (although all signature plans carry those channels).\n\n\n                          Fubo is the streaming service for sports fans. Its huge library of channels includes regional and international sports leagues, setting it apart from the competition. You can also tack on additional programming to your plan, but it'll cost you extra.\n                        \n\nSpecifics\n\nFubo is a sports fan's best friend when it comes to streaming, especially if you're into football, baseball, soccer, golf, or women's basketball. It was initially started as a soccer streaming service, but it has morphed into one of the most robust live TV packages out there. Standard Pro plans cost $84.99 a month and offer over 150+ channels right off the bat. From there, fans can get add-ons for additional channel packages. This includes the $9.99 monthly Sports Lite add-on for NBA TV, MLB Network, and the Tennis Channel, among others. All plans include regional sports options, which come with their own additional monthly fees, so you'll most likely be paying a bit more than the initial price tag.\n\nGiven that it's catered toward sports, the only notable flaw is the omission of TNT and TBS, eliminating a batch of NBA, NHL, and Unrivaled games each season. Otherwise, it is one of the best true cable alternatives out there, given its broad catalog of channels and comprehensive local network coverage (like ABC, NBC, FOX, and, notably, CBS), the latter of which is often missing from live TV services.\n\n\n                          Sling TV offers some of the best cable channels for $61 or less. There are three different tiers to choose from, plus several sports and entertainment-specific add-ons, but the Orange + Blue combo is the best way to get the most major sports channels. Plus, you can usually get about half off your first month.\n                        \n\nSpecifics\n\nSling TV is one of the more affordable live TV packages, with an adaptable slate of plans that can easily be tailored to your budget and specific sports needs. Sling Orange and Blue, the two base plans, each cost $45.99 a month. Each includes anywhere from 35-43 channels, with certain options exclusive to each plan (Orange carries several ESPN channels, while Blue has FS1 and the NFL Network). If you combine the two for the Sling Orange + Blue plan, you can find some savings at just $60.99 a month and get the most out of Sling's sports offerings. The Blue and combo plans cost $5 extra in select areas with robust local channel coverage.\n\nWhere Sling differs from some of its pricier live TV counterparts is in the local channel coverage. A Sling Blue or Sling Orange + Blue combo plan can provide some local channels (like NBC, ABC, or FOX) in certain regions, but coverage is selective, and Sling is missing CBS altogether. Fortunately, if you live in a region that cannot stream local channels on Sling, the streaming service has a fairly generous offer that will send you a free HD antenna if you prepay for a few months, which should allow you to supplement any major missing local networks.\n\n\n                          ESPN Plus is designed for sports, giving subscribers access to live MLB, NHL, NFL, soccer, golf, and UFC fights. You can pay $12 monthly or go for an annual deal, which saves you about $20 a year. There's also a bundle with Hulu and Disney Plus, which offers an even better discount. \n                        \n\nSpecifics\n\nIf you're not looking for a live TV package and want something more ESPN-specific, you can try out ESPN+. There's just one plan (for $11.99 a month, although you can bundle with other services) that gives subscribers access to select live games and on-demand content. ESPN+ isn't a direct live stream of the ESPN channel, and the games the service covers are fairly selective. In addition to select ESPN games, the streamer also carries live coverage of certain ESPN2 and ABC games.\n\nWhere ESPN+ truly shines is with its event-specific coverage. The streaming service often offers live coverage of niche tennis and golf tournaments. Additionally, the app has an impressive selection of collegiate-level games, including several basketball match-ups that aren't available nationally anywhere else. It has popular pay-per-view (PPV) content, most notably with UFC. People without cable who want to watch UFC main events must have an ESPN+ subscription and pay an additional PPV fee through the service.\n\n\n                          Paramount Plus offers a huge library of on-demand content from Paramount, CBS, Nickelodeon, Comedy Central, BET, and MTV. The Premium Plan also includes Showtime and live CBS streaming. It costs $12.99 a month or $120 a year. More importantly, it removes ads from the on-demand streaming library. \n                        \n\nSpecifics\n\nCBS is a fixture in most major sports leagues, so access to the network has become paramount (no pun intended) to the average sports fan's viewing experiences. Enter Paramount+, formerly CBS All Access, which is best known for its on-demand catalog of original CBS broadcast series and several of the latest film releases from Paramount Pictures.\n\nParamount+ Essential plans cost $7.99 a month, but you should upgrade to Paramount+ with Showtime for $12.99 a month if you're hoping to tap into CBS and CBS Sports Network live streams. This will give you access to select NWSL, PGA, WNBA, Big Ten Football, and March Madness coverage. Fortunately, both available Paramount+ plans allow you to live stream the NFL on CBS and the UEFA Champions League.\n\n\n                          DAZN is a sports streaming service with live and on-demand content, including exclusive boxing matches. It's also available in a vast amount of countries around the world. Many events require an additional PPV fee, but a base subscription also offers its own slate of content.\n                        \n\nSpecifics\n\nDAZN is a truly global sports streaming service, with select coverage available in more than 200 regions. The service carries tons of sports, but it's best known for its PPV boxing events. Subscription prices vary from region to region, but in the US, you can get a subscription for $29.99 monthly for the flexible pass, or $19.99 monthly when you lock in for 12 months. PPV prices are a bit steeper, but they are the only way to watch the big events, with most major fight cards costing around $50 to $80.\n\nThe service also offers MMA, Esports, and women's football, among other sporting events, although exact offerings are specific to each country, and not all events are available on a global scale. International viewers can also purchase packages like the NFL Game Pass, which offers every regular game of the NFL season, in addition to the Playoffs and Super Bowl.\n\n\n                          Peacock is a convenient streaming source for hit NBC TV shows, Universal movies, and select sports like Sunday Night Football. The service also carries its own slate of original programming.\n                        \n\nSpecifics\n\nIf you purchased a Peacock subscription for the Olympics, it could be worth holding onto. While the service is often thought of for its catalog of popular NBC sitcoms like The Office and Parks and Recreation, it also offers ample sporting coverage of select events broadcast on NBCUniversal networks. Thanks to live streams of NBC Sports and other channels, including designated sports hubs, coverage of most major cycling races and golf tournaments can be found here. The app also carries select college sporting events from the Big Ten Conference.\n\nIf you upgrade from Premium ($7.99) to Premium Plus ($13.99), you can live stream NBC 24/7. While you can watch Sunday Night Football and select sports live with either plan, the Premium Plus option will also unlock additional options via the aforementioned NBC live stream. This tier also makes on-demand content ad-free and allows viewers to download select content to watch offline.\n\n\n                          Amazon Prime Video is a capable, competitive streaming service that's more than just a Prime membership perk. You can also sign up for a stand-alone plan at $9/month. \n                        \n\nSpecifics\n\nLive sports might not be the main draw to Amazon for most people, but the Prime Video platform has become a live TV hub in the past few years, with an emphasis on some top sports. Prime Video is the official home of Thursday Night Football and the 2024 Black Friday Football game. The service also has exclusive rights to several WNBA games on Thursday nights, NWSL games on Friday nights, and other select sporting events.\n\nPrime Video's live streaming options are included in standard Amazon Prime subscriptions, which cost $14.99 a month. You can also just subscribe to Prime Video for $8.99 a month. Select events will be included with a PPV fee, and many of the best sports streaming services allow you to subscribe via an add-on in Prime Video if you'd rather have all of your watch options in one place. The NBA League Pass and WNBA League Pass are available for an extra fee through Prime Video as well.\n\n\n                          Apple TV Plus has a limited lineup, but it's less expensive than other ad-free services and offers a growing selection of critically acclaimed series you can't stream anywhere else.\n                        \n\nSpecifics\n\nApple's TV counterpart might be best known for its prestige scripted series, but the streaming service has begun to dip its toes into live sports over the past year or two. The crown jewel of Apple TV+'s sports content is the MLS Season Pass, which allows viewers to watch every match (including the Leagues Cup and MLS Cup Playoffs) without blackout restrictions. A standard Apple TV+ subscription will also grant you access to two MLB games every Friday night.\n\nAn Apple TV+ subscription costs $9.99 a month (although you can usually get a few months free if you purchase a new Apple product), and the MLS Season Pass costs an additional $12.99 a month or $39 a season. If you don't have an Apple TV+ subscription, you can also just buy an MLS Season pass for $14.99 a month or $49 a season.\n\n\n                          Max's Standard plan includes ad-free on-demand streaming for HBO series, Warner Bros. blockbusters, original Max shows, and much more. Plus, all ad-free subscribers get the B/R Sports Add-on, so they can live stream NBA, NHL, MLB, and more for no extra cost.\n                        \n\nSpecifics\n\nHBO's streaming counterpart might not be the first thing that comes to mind when you think of sports, but the streaming service rolled out a new B/R Sports Add-on last year, bringing live and on-demand sports to the platform. Max offers live streams of games that air on Warner Bros. Discovery channels like TNT and TBS, making it a particularly handy app during the MLB, NHL, NBA, and Unrivaled seasons. The streaming service also live streams select other sports that might not have a broadcast home in the US, including several major global cycling events.\n\nThe B/R Sports Add-on was initially included for free with all Max plans, with the idea that it would eventually cost an extra $9.99 a month. However, Max announced in 2025 that the add-on will remain a free perk of service, but only with the ad-free tiers, so sports fans will need to subscribe to Ad-Free for $16.99 a month or Ultimate Ad-Free (4K and other perks) for $20.99 a month. The service also has annual plans, which offer savings to users who commit to a yearlong subscription.\n\nNBA fans need a variety of channels to watch weekly games, including various networks from the ESPN/ABC and TNT/TBS family of channels. NBA TV is also a necessity for any NBA fan, although this is a bit more of a niche option that falls outside many streaming services' standard base plans. Sling TV and DirecTV are two services that will allow you to watch everything (with the help of some add-ons), while streamers like Fubo and Max offer select networks and games. Check out our how to watch NBA games streaming guide for a full breakdown of services.\n\nThe WNBA season is spread across a few different families of networks, including ESPN, ESPN2, ESPN3, ABC, CBS, CBS Sports Network, ION, and NBA TV. Fans who want to watch absolutely every game will also need to subscribe to Prime Video, which holds exclusive rights to Thursday night games. Sling TV, DirecTV, and Fubo will be able to help you out for the most part, but if you want to live stream every single national broadcast, your best bet is subscribing to one of the higher-tiered DirecTV or Fubo plans (in addition to signing up for Prime). You can also try out the WNBA League Pass.\n\nAlthough ESPN and MLB will go their separate ways after the 2025 season, baseball fans will still need the network for the remainder of the year. Other nationally broadcast games will air on TBS, Fox Sports 1 (FS1), FOX, and the MLB Network. You can find these networks through DirecTV, Sling TV, and Fubo's various plans and add-ons, although TBS will be missing from the latter. You can also try out MLB.TV. TBS games are also usually available on Max, and Apple TV+ is the exclusive home of two games every Friday night. Additionally, tons of MLB games air on regional sports networks and don't have national broadcasts. Fubo offers robust regional coverage in both of its main plans, but you can also get the MyHome Team mini pack add-on to DirecTV's MySports.\n\nAlthough a decent amount of NHL games fall on regional sports networks, the national broadcasts are mainly found on ABC, ESPN, and TNT/TBS. Unlike some other sports with ABC and ESPN broadcasts, ESPN+ is a great option for NHL fans since it carries live streams of several of the games. ESPN+ also has a selection of exclusive NHL games, meaning that you might need the service even if you have a solid cable subscription. Sling TV and DirecTV are two of the best ways to ensure you don't miss out on any national broadcasts, but Fubo and Max will also be able to help you out with select games. For more info, you can explore our guide on how to watch NHL games.\n\nEach year, NFL games are spread across several different networks, making it all but impossible to keep up with the season unless you have cable or a streaming service like DirecTV or Fubo. Nationally broadcast games air on NBC, CBS, Fox, ABC, ESPN, and the NFL Network. Additionally, Prime Video exclusively carries Thursday Night Football. If you're only looking to watch NBC games, Peacock will be able to help you out. Similarly, CBS games are available on Paramount Plus. Sling TV is also able to live stream many games, but local channel coverage varies by region (and CBS is unavailable in all areas), so you should check your ZIP code before subscribing. You can find a full roundup of streaming services in our how to watch NFL games breakdown.\n\nThe short answer is that there is no one sure-fire sports streaming service that's going to be the answer to all needs. We ranked ESPN Plus as the \"best for sports\" in our guide to the best streaming services (which doesn't include live TV streaming packages) since the service is so tailored towards sports and often carries exclusive streaming-only games that you can't even get with cable.\n\nThat said, in the ever-complicated era of the streaming wars, the best sports streaming service is going to be the one that carries your favorite team or league's games. Since network licenses and rights are always changing, you can't go wrong with a live TV streaming package like DirecTV, Sling, or Fubo. But gaps in coverage on things like local channels and Warner Bros. networks might make Sling or Fubo not ideal for your needs and instead pave the way for services like DirecTV.\n\nThe \"skinny\" package is one of the latest and most enticing trends in sports streaming, but it's also the cause of some of the more recent streaming-related headaches. Streaming services are beginning to launch skinny plans, which cater to specific interests (like sports) by offering things like sports-only channels for a cheaper price than an all-encompassing streaming package.\n\nIn January 2025, DirecTV was one of the first major players to launch a skinny plan, MySports, which offers 25+ key sports channels for $70 a month, $15 less than DirecTV's base signature plan.\n\nOther services will most likely follow suit. In Fall 2024, a Disney, Fox, and Warner Bros. Discovery sports streaming service was supposed to launch under the name Venu Sports, but this was halted by a lawsuit from Fubo. The dispute lasted through the 2024-2025 NFL regular season, but Disney announced in January 2025 that Fubo and Hulu + Live TV would merge in business (while staying separate apps), settling litigation on Venu. According to the Disney announcement, Fubo will be able to launch its own Sports & Broadcast service with Disney's relevant networks, so it's most likely only a matter of time before consumers will be able to subscribe to a skinny Fubo sports plan.\n\nDisney canned plans for Venu Sports, but a new ESPN streaming service is in the works. The streamer, simply called ESPN, is slated to debut later this year and will cost $29.99 a month. FOX is also launching its own all-inclusive stand-alone service, FOX One. While the FOX service hasn't announced any prices yet, the streamer is aiming to launch in the fall ahead of the NFL and college football seasons.\n\nUltra-high-def streaming is hard to come by, especially for live events, but some services have the option. Your best bet will be with one of the aforementioned live TV streaming packages. Sling TV, DirecTV, and Fubo (through Fubo's Elite plan) all offer select 4K live streaming. These are typically for special events, especially big games, with a network that has 4K streaming capabilities. FOX, which enabled 4K viewing for the Super Bowl this year, offers UHD live streaming across all three services when available. ESPN is another popular sports network that occasionally offers programming in 4K. When not in 4K, most of the services stream in 720p or 1080p, depending on whether you're accessing live or on-demand content.\n\nHulu + Live TV also has 4K streaming, although it appears to just be available for select Hulu on-demand content and not part of the live offerings. Max also has 4K capabilities with its highest Ultimate Ad-Free plan, but this also appears to be exclusive to select on-demand content.\n\nThe 2025 NBA Playoffs air on ESPN, ABC, TNT, and NBA TV. The 2025 NHL Playoffs air on ESPN, ESPN2, ABC, TNT, truTV, and TBS. This means that live TV streaming services like Sling TV and DirecTV are the best ways to live stream every game for both leagues (although Fubo, Max, and ESPN+ will also be able to help you out for select match-ups). For more info, check out our guides on how to watch the NBA Playoffs and how to watch the NHL Playoffs.\n\n\n\n\n\nYou can purchase logo and accolade licensing to this story here.Disclosure: Written and researched by the Insider Reviews team.

Despite all the star-studded talent, Duke commit, Cooper Flagg was chosen as a member of the USA Select Team and has impressed many with his performance.    \n\n Orlando Magic\n\n head coach, Jamahl Mosley, was chosen to be the coach for the USA Select Team. After having the opportunity to coach and see Flagg compete against the best players in the world, he was pleasantly surprised in discussions with ESPN.    \n\n\"[Cooper Flagg] has a high basketball IQ, tough, willing to learn. He gets to the spots that he needs to for a shot a lot, able to get to the rim, great touch on his shot. I mean, he can play. There’s no in between. There’s me saying, in many different forms, he can just flat out play.” - Jamahl Mosley\n\n\nFlagg became the first collegiate player to receive an invitation to be a part of the Select Team since                 Marcus Smart\n\n and                 Doug McDermott\n\n in 2013. The decision that was made for the Maine native to be a part of Team USA was something he wasn't expecting.    \n\n\"I was pretty surprised just because it's not like a normal thing. So I was definitely really honored and just excited that I had this opportunity.\" - Cooper Flagg\n\nDespite being the top-rated prospect of the 2025 NBA Draft, Flagg displayed no signs of pride, and instead, showcased extreme humility in being given the opportunity to receive the highly esteemed honor.\n\n\"If you think about it, you're able to learn from ... if you look at their team, it's nobody better. So it's just being come out here and learn, this is a great experience and I'm really just humbled and I'm really grateful and blessed that I was selected.\" - Cooper Flagg\n\nFlagg was already primed to thrive on the college stage, but after having this experience learning from the best players in the world, the NCAA could be in trouble this upcoming season.\n\n In sports, it's important to be confident in yourself, but being too egotistical can get your career wrapped up quickly. At the young age of 17 years old, Flagg has already found the perfect balance of what is needed to thrive on the basketball court.\n\nThe Duke Blue Devils hold the top rank of all collegiate teams ahead of the 2024-25 season according to Rivals. Flagg's skillset and motor, which made him a dominant force in his high school career, could potentially reach another level following his experience with Team USA.\n\nCooper Flagg 2023-24 High School Season Stats\n\nCategory\n\nStats\n\nPTS\n\n16.1\n\nREB\n\n7.6\n\nAST\n\n3.9\n\nBLK\n\n2.7\n\nFG%\n\n54.8\n\nFlagg led Montverde Academy to an undefeated 31-0 record. He was selected as the Gatorade Player of the Year and was recognized as the best player in high school basketball. He takes his talents to Duke and will have other great prospects on his team, which will require him to adjust to different roles as he's done so far in his basketball career.\n\nThe 2025 NBA Draft class has already made waves of their talent and the collegiate season hasn't even started yet.\n\nAttention has been directed to Cooper Flagg, but VJ Edgecombe displayed on the international stage that he is one of the best prospects.\n\nWe want to hear from you!

I cannot change. We tried every possible way to talk with many organisations.\n\n\"Yeah, for now I just want to raise awareness, to raise funds for people in need, to raise support for the kids through my foundation, through United24.

They believed in me. There is no more question about how I feel. It's just already long time my journey as a Kazak player.

Presumably, part of the agreement that Olise negotiated after transferring from Crystal Palace would be that he retains the opportunity to represent his country this summer.\n\nPlaying at the Olympics will mean that Olise will miss essentially the entirety of Bayern’s preseason prep, and this is most definitely not a good thing. Preseason is the perfect time for new signings to get accustomed to the new environment, create chemistry with their teammates, and train with the squad full time. \n\nMissing this preparation period will deprive Olise of something he will need as a young and new player. The Olympics will be hosted in the French squad’s backyard, with games to be played in almost all the major cities of France, so at least Olise won’t be too far away from the training grounds. \n\n\n    Related\n  \n\nLooking for more thoughts and analysis of Germany’s crushing 2-1 loss to Spain?

But at the end of the day I think a lot of the players in a similar situation would have done the same thing, prioritising their body. I still stand by making the right call. Obviously he was disappointed because it’s his last match. But, yeah, what a champion. I think that hopefully he’ll play in the Olympics and have another farewell there.”\n\nRaducanu said she and Murray had not discussed what might happen if she went deep in the singles and might have to pull out.\n\n“I was feeling fine, then yesterday morning just woke up with stiffness,” she said. “I have to prioritise myself, my singles and my body. I think it was the right decision. I stand by the decision. Obviously it was a tough decision, though, because it’s something that I’ve always wanted to do.\n\n“I think going into the tournament, I wasn’t expecting to make the fourth round. I would love to have played. He didn’t ask me: ‘If you’re still in the singles, are you going to play?’ That was never a question to be answered. Given how I woke up yesterday morning, it was for me a no-brainer.”\n\nAnd Raducanu played down the significance of a post on social media by Judy Murray which said “astonishing” in response to the Briton’s withdrawal, a comment Murray later clarified as being sarcasm, adding that the schedule had been a factor. “I’m sure she didn’t mean it,” Raducanu said.\n\nDespite her exit from Wimbledon, Raducanu said she has “got her fire back” and is determined to continue climbing the rankings.\n\nSign up to The Recap\n\nThe best of our sports journalism from the past seven days and a heads-up on the weekend’s action\n\nafter newsletter promotion\n\n“For sure there are areas I need to keep improving,” she said. “I think I improved a few things.

        "expanded content": "In less than three weeks, when India’s athletes touch down in Paris for the Olympic Games, they will be travelling from different corners of the world — Japan to Germany, US to Turkey.\n\nFor the Indian sports ecosystem, these journeys may well be the signoff on three years of preparations for the mega world event — on a scale never seen before, documents accessed by The Indian Express under the RTI Act show.\n\nThey range from living quarters in Germany for a badminton entourage to special feed for horses in the equestrian event, according to the minutes of meetings held almost every Thursday afternoon over the past three years by India’s Mission Olympic Cell (MOC).\n\nConsider this:\n\n* A team of 12 specialists helping badminton ace P V Sindhu in her quest for a third Olympic medal at a boot camp in the German industrial town of Saarbrucken.\n\n* A table of the same make that will be used at the Olympics imported from China for table tennis star Manika Batra to get used to its pace, spin and bounce.\n\n* Special horse feed for equestrian prospect Anush Agarwalla’s dark chestnut gelding, along with equipment including saddle pads, boots and blankets.\n\n* iPad and high-speed cameras for weightlifter Mirabai Chanu.\n\nThe MOC includes former athletes, Indian and foreign coaches, high-performance directors and officials from the federations and government. And its meetings are significant because even though such preparation is normal for major sporting nations like the USA and China, they show that Indian sport has finally caught up with global standards — at least in scale.\n\nOverall, officials say, Rs 72 crore were spent under the Target Olympic Podium Scheme (TOPS) during the three-year Olympic cycle from Tokyo in Covid-hit 2021 to Paris — almost double that of Rio 2016. And, according to the RTI documents, the MOC approved 403 proposals from about 100 Paris hopefuls under TOPS, while rejecting 50, between May 2023 and May 2024.\n\nThe approved proposals covered a range of equipment, facilities and customised training plans: shoes to sunglasses, high-end sports watches to high-speed cameras, traditional equipment to cutting-edge technologies, and clothes, food and supplements.\n\nOfficials acknowledge that expenditure isn’t proportional to the final medal count. Yet, if the projections made by federations of five sports central to India’s hopes come true (see box), the country could breach the double-digit mark for the first time in the French capital. At the previous Tokyo Olympics, India won seven medals, including a first-ever gold in track and field from Neeraj Chopra in javelin. It was India’s best performance at the Olympics.\n\n\n\nThis time, documents show, the Athletics Federation of India has estimated that the sport would contribute two medals to the overall tally. Boxing has predicted three, badminton has raised the possibility of “two-three” medals while archery and weightlifting have put their calculations at one medal each.\n\nIn Tokyo, apart from Chopra’s gold in these five sports, boxing, badminton and weightlifting had contributed one medal each while archery drew a blank. For Paris, the assessments of other major sports like hockey, wrestling and shooting, were not listed in the documents.\n\nFor Paris, an illustrative example of the level of preparation is the case of Sindhu.\n\nThe two-time Olympic medallist has been camping in Saarbrucken since June 15. Accompanying her is a mentor (Prakash Padukone), a chief coach, two assistant coaches, two physios, one strength and conditioning expert and five sparring partners.\n\nSindhu will be stationed there until July 20, when she will leave for Paris. To make sure she remains fresh, her room has been fitted with a “bigger TV”, and a lounge facility has been created to relax, conduct meetings and be used as storage space.\n\nThese expenses were split three ways. While the government and Sindhu’s backers, Olympic Gold Quest, shouldered a majority of the cost, the athlete herself partly contributed.\n\nSindhu also has an infrared sauna cabin to aid her recovery post-training. But then, she isn’t the only one to go big on recovery tools. Fellow shuttler H S Prannoy was provided funds to undergo Hyperbaric Oxygen therapy and Red Light therapy to heal his body after punishing workouts. Funds were allotted for table tennis flag-bearer Sharath Kamal to put his body through a slew of tests, including blood, genetic and bone density scans.\n\nTwo-time world champion boxer Nikhat Zareen, meanwhile, got a laser unit. “Boxing is such a sport where minor injuries happen after every sparring session. It can be a small area where the muscle is tight or a manageable injury. The laser helps in healing that area,” she told The Indian Express.\n\nOfficials point out that all of this is in stark contrast to the situation barely a decade ago.\n\nIn 2016, it was only after an inconsolable Dutee Chand burst into tears in public, two weeks before the Rio Olympics, that the country’s sports bureaucracy swung into action, wire-transferring her money to buy running shoes.\n\nFor the 2012 Olympics, bronze medallist Mary Kom had to rely largely on her private sponsors to hire a foreign coach and train abroad leading up to the Games.\n\nAnd, shooter Abhinav Bindra narrated in his autobiography how “completely disillusioned” he was when he went to meet the Sports Ministry officials in 2006 to request “funds for coaching, for equipment, for training”.\n\n\n\n\n\n"

        "expanded content": "Anthony Edwards is as confident - or cocky, depending on how you look at it - as ever ahead of the Olympics\n\nNayan Brahmbhatt\n\nAnthony Edwards, the superstar guard for the Minnesota Timberwolves, has been making headlines with his bold statements regarding his role on Team USA. Edwards, who has quickly become one of the most exciting young players in the NBA, is currently representing the United States in international competition.\n\nDespite sharing the court with other elite talents, Edwards has made it clear that he sees himself as the primary option for Team USA. His recent comments have sparked discussions about his confidence, leadership, and future potential in both international and NBA play.\n\nDuring an interview, Edwards did not mince words about his perception of his role on Team USA.\n\n“I’m still the number one option. Y’all might look at it differently… I just go out there and be myself, shoot my shots, play defense and they got to fit in around me. That’s how I feel,” he declared.\n\nThis statement underscores Edwards' unwavering self-belief and his determination to assert himself as a leader on a team filled with top-tier talent.\n\nEdwards’ assertion about being the number one option speaks volumes about his confidence and burgeoning leadership qualities. At just 22 years old, his willingness to take on a leading role in an environment filled with seasoned veterans and other rising stars is indicative of his mental fortitude and competitive spirit. This mindset is something that the Timberwolves will undoubtedly value as they look to build around Edwards for the future.\n\nHis performance in the NBA has backed up his confident demeanor. Last season, Edwards averaged 25.9 points, 5.4 rebounds, and 5.1 assists per game, showcasing his ability to contribute across multiple facets of the game. His scoring prowess, combined with his defensive abilities, makes him a versatile and valuable player on any roster.\n\nFor Team USA, having a player like Edwards who is willing to step up and take charge can be both a blessing and a challenge. His confidence can inspire and elevate his teammates, pushing everyone to perform at a higher level. However, it also requires careful balancing by the coaching staff to ensure that the team’s chemistry remains intact and that all players are utilized effectively.\n\nHistorically, Team USA has been composed of many stars who have had to adjust their roles and sometimes take a back seat for the greater good of the team. Edwards’ approach, while bold, is not unprecedented. Players like Kobe Bryant and Kevin Durant have also exhibited similar mindsets during their stints with Team USA, and their leadership and scoring abilities were crucial to the team’s success.\n\nIn international play, Edwards has continued to demonstrate why he considers himself the top option. His aggressive scoring, athleticism, and defensive intensity have been on full display. These attributes are critical in international basketball, where the style of play can be markedly different from the NBA, often emphasizing physicality and team-oriented strategies.\n\nEdwards’ ability to adapt and excel in this environment further solidifies his status as a rising star. His performance not only benefits Team USA in their quest for international dominance but also enhances his reputation and experience, which he will bring back to the Timberwolves.\n\nLooking ahead, Edwards’ performance and leadership with Team USA will likely influence his role and responsibilities with the Timberwolves. His experience on the international stage can help him become a more well-rounded player, capable of leading his NBA team through challenging situations.\n\nThe confidence Edwards displays now can translate into an even more assertive and effective leadership during the NBA season.\n\nMoreover, his time with Team USA provides him with an opportunity to build relationships with other elite players, potentially paving the way for future collaborations or even recruitment to Minnesota. These connections and experiences are crucial as the Timberwolves aim to build a team capable of competing for championships.\n\nAnthony Edwards' bold statement about his role on Team USA reflects his immense confidence and readiness to lead. His performance in international play supports his claim, showcasing his scoring ability, defensive prowess, and leadership qualities.\n\nFor the Timberwolves, Edwards' development into a confident leader is a promising sign for their future. As he continues to grow and gain experience, both in the NBA and on the international stage, Edwards has the potential to become one of the league's premier players and lead Minnesota to new heights.\n\nNayan Brahmbhatt is an Associate Editor for ClutchPoints, with expertise in covering the NFL and NBA in particular.

        "expanded content": "Emma Raducanu came under fire for her decision to pull out of the Wimbledon mixed doubles with Andy Murray, but she has hit back by insisting the decision was a ‘no brainer’.\n\nRaducanu was stunned by qualifier Lulu Sun as her encouraging Wimbledon run came to a disappointing end in the fourth round.\n\nThe 21-year-old had inspired hopes of more US Open-style heroics by coming through her opening three matches without dropping a set.\n\nBut she looked nervous against powerful New Zealander Sun, the first qualifier to make the women’s singles quarter-finals here in 14 years, and, despite battling to force a deciding set, slumped to a 6-2, 5-7, 6-2 defeat.\n\nHer post-match press conference was dominated by questions about her move to withdraw from the doubles with Murray, with the decision ending his career at Wimbledon.\n\n“I don’t think it was a mistake (to enter the doubles) because I was feeling fine, then yesterday morning just woke up with stiffness,” she said.\n\n“I have to prioritise myself, my singles and my body. I think it was the right decision. I stand by the decision.\n\n“Yeah, obviously it was a tough decision, though, because it’s something that I’ve always wanted to do.\n\n“Of course, I didn’t want to take his last match away from him, but at the end of the day, I think a lot of the players in a similar situation would have done the same thing, prioritising their body. Yeah, I still stand by making the right call.\n\n“I think with every decision, people are entitled to their opinions. Of course, there was a bit of a cloud around the decision.\n\n“I don’t think I would have done it any other way. I think in this sport especially, as an individual, you have to make your own calls and prioritize yourself. Especially with my history, I just had to put myself first.”\n\nWhen asked how Murray reacted when she told him she was pulling out she said: “I mean, obviously disappointed because it’s his last match.\n\n“But, yeah, what a champion. I think that hopefully he’ll play in the Olympics and have another farewell there.”\n\nThe hostile questioning didn’t stop there, as Raducanu admitted her singles progress at Wimbledon took her by surprise and contributed to the decision to pull out of the mixed doubles.\n\n“I think going into the tournament, I wasn’t expecting to make fourth round. So for me, it was a no-brainer,” she added.\n\n“I would have loved to have played. He didn’t ask me, if you’re still in the singles, are you going to play? That was never a question to be answered.\n\n“Given how I woke up yesterday morning, it was for me a no-brainer.”\n\nRaducanu also suggested Judy Murray didn’t mean to be critical of her decision to withdraw from the mixed doubles in a tweet that went viral on Saturday, with the 21-year-old facing a less-than-positive grilling on a day when her Wimbledon dreams died.\n\n\n                Emma Raducanu has claimed top-ranked players are getting an unfair advantage at Roland Garros.            \n\n\n                Emma Raducanu reveals she was 'really sick' prior to her opening match at Roland Garros.            \n\n\n                Raducanu battled past Wang Xinyu to end a three-year wait for a Roland Garros match win.            \n\n\n                \"I’m looking forward to seeing him around and having a conversation.\"            \n\n© Planet Sport Limited 2025 • All Rights Reserved"

Read our Privacy notice\n\nEmma Raducanu said she stands by her decision to withdraw from her Wimbledon mixed-doubles match with Andy Murray after exiting the singles tournament following a three-set defeat to qualifier Lulu Sun.\n\nRaducanu woke up with a stiff wrist on Saturday and informed Murray that she would be prioritising her involvement in the singles, even though it denied the two-time champion a final match at the All England Club.\n\nThe 21-year-old was then knocked out in the singles in the fourth round by world number 123 Sun on Centre Court on Sunday, losing in three sets to the qualifier as she struggled with her lower back.\n\nDespite receiving some criticism for pulling out of her match with Murray, Raducanu said she did not regret accepting the 37-year-old’s offer to play in the mixed doubles. \n\nThe former US Open champion admitted that she did not expect to reach the fourth round of Wimbledon and said it was a “no-brainer” to prioritise her fitness over allowing Murray a final farewell. \n\n“I don’t think it was a mistake because I was feeling fine, then yesterday morning just woke up with stiffness,” Raducanu said. “I have to prioritise myself, my singles and my body.\n\n“I think it was the right decision.

I think in this sport especially, as an individual, you have to make your own calls and prioritise yourself. Especially with my history, I just had to put myself first.”\n\nRaducanu missed last year’s Wimbledon after undergoing surgery on both her wrists as well as one of her ankles. The wildcard, who was the last Briton standing in the singles draw, said her sore wrist came as a result of her recent workload on grass.\n\n“I just woke up yesterday with a bit of stiff wrist,” she said. “With the balls being quite heavy in the grass, it’s just something that I have to manage. I’ve been playing on the grass for quite a few weeks now. I think I just had to prioritise my singles.\n\n“I’ve been managing a stiff back since yesterday. I think it was just exaggerated today, I’d say. I was feeling it during the match. I think especially on serve it was affecting me a bit.”\n\nRaducanu, who matched her best performance at a grand slam since winning the US Open by reaching the fourth round, also said she had not discussed with Murray what they would do about their mixed-doubles tournament if she reached the second week of Wimbledon.\n\n“I think going into the tournament, I wasn’t expecting to make fourth round. So for me it was a no-brainer. I would have loved to have played,” she added. \n\n“He didn’t ask me, ‘If you’re still in the singles, are you going to play?’ That was never a question to be answered.

The decision appeared to draw criticism from Murray's mother Judy, though she later moved to clarify her comments.\n\nThe former US Open champion pulled out of Wimbledon altogether in 2023 as she underwent wrist surgery. She made it as far as the fourth round on her return to SW19 this year, equalling her best performance at Wimbledon, only to be eliminated by qualifier Lulu Sun.\n\nAfter her defeat, Raducanu was asked about her mixed doubles decision. Despite the result on Sunday, though, she did not appear to have any regrets.\n\n“I don’t think it was a mistake because I was feeling fine, then [Saturday] morning just woke up with stiffness,\" Raducanu told reporters. \"I have to prioritise myself, my singles and my body. I think it was the right decision. I stand by the decision. Obviously it was a tough decision, though, because it’s something that I’ve always wanted to do.”\n\nShe also insisted Murray never asked whether a run to the fourth round might impact her doubles involvement. \"That was never a question to be answered,\" she said. \"Given how I woke up yesterday morning, it was for me a no-brainer [to withdraw].”\n\nWhen asked about Judy Murray's comments, Raducanu made it clear she had been unaware of any reaction to her decision. However, she maintained people are \"entitled to their opinions\".\n\nWas Emma Raducanu right to withdraw from the mixed doubles? Have your say in the comments section\n\nRaducanu's withdrawal means Andy Murray's men's doubles defeat alongside brother Jamie ended up being his final Wimbledon appearance. The two-time champion is expected to call time on his career later this year, though he is part of the Team GB squad as he aims to bow out with Olympic gold.\n\n“It was a very difficult decision,\" Raducanu added when discussing her withdrawal from the mixed doubles. \"Of course, I didn’t want to take his last match away from him, but at the end of the day I think a lot of the players in a similar situation would have done the same thing.\n\n“But yeah, what a champion. I think that hopefully he’ll play in the Olympics and have another farewell there,\" she added. Raducanu was offered a wild card for the Olympics herself, but has opted not to take part.\n\nWas Raducanu right to pull out of the mixed doubles with Murray? Vote in our poll HERE to have your say.\n\nRaducanu wasn't the only high-profile player eliminated from the women's singles on Sunday. Number two seed Coco Gauff was eliminated by fellow American Emma Navarro, meaning just one of the top five seeds is still in the women's singles draw.\n\n\"Coco’s obviously an amazing player and I have a ton of respect for her and what she’s done at such a young age is amazing,\" Navarro told the BBC after her win.\n\n\"I knew she wasn’t going to make it easy on me tonight but I wanted to play aggressively and push back against her game and I think I was able to do that.\"\n\nAt Reach and across our entities we and our partners use information collected through cookies and other identifiers from your device to improve experience on our site, analyse how it is used and to show personalised advertising.

I really believe we have an incredible team and we can accomplish something special.”\n\nGeorgios Papagiannis scored 19 points for Greece, who also got 14 from Nick Calathes and earned an Olympic berth for the first time since 2008.\n\n“It’s very nice to qualify because that’s the first step,” Papagiannis said. “At the Olympics, we’re looking to do something really good there.”\n\nGreece will be in Group A for the Paris Games, with opening-stage games against Australia, Canada and Spain – who also qualified on Sunday by beating the Bahamas.\n\nThe defending champions USA, as well as France, Germany, Japan, Serbia, South Sudan, Canada and Australia had already qualified. France qualified as the host nation; the other seven teams on the list qualified based on their finishes at the World Cup last summer.\n After the World Cup, 24 teams were left to compete for the final four slots. They were decided in the winner-take-all qualifiers that started last week. Brazil grabbed the first of those spots on Sunday, before Greece, Spain and Puerto Rico followed.\n\nOn Saturday, Antetokounmpo had come up against another perennial NBA All-Star, Luka Dončić, in the semi-finals. Antetokounmpo and Greece beat Dončić’s Slovenia 96-68.\n\n“They played way better than us. They were way more aggressive,” Dončić said. “I think they have an amazing team. Obviously, they have Giannis. But other pieces are very important for them, too. And they’re very well-coached ... They outplayed us today.”"

(AP Photo/Steve Marcus)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLAS VEGAS (AP) — He first played on the U.S. Olympic team as a 19-year-old. He did it again in his 20s, twice. And now, a few months from turning 40, he’s back for one more run.\n\nLeBron James didn’t need another Olympic experience to complete some missing box on his resume or add to a legacy that was secured long, long ago. He decided to play this summer for one simple reason — because he wants to.\n\nTaking his first steps toward becoming the first U.S. men’s basketball player to compete at the Olympics in three different decades, James hit the floor Saturday with the team that the Americans are sending to the Paris Games later this month. Training camp opened in Las Vegas, the start of a 5 1/2-week quest where the only acceptable ending will be the U.S. winning gold for a fifth consecutive time.\n\n“I’m still playing a high level,” James, a three-time Olympic medalist — two golds and one bronze — said Saturday after the first workout. “I still love the game of basketball. And Team USA has done well by me, so I felt like it was important for this summer to be able to go out there and play with the rest of the guys.”\n\nThe first practice came on a day of another first for the James family; the workout in Las Vegas was simultaneous to the Los Angeles Lakers’ first game in the California Classic summer league — the pro debut of Bronny James, the son of the NBA’s all-time scoring leader.\n\nIt would have been very easy for James to ask for Day 1 off, to go see his son’s debut. It was never a consideration. He took the floor shortly after the buses rolled in, slapping hands with teammates, throwing down dunks and reconnecting with two of his former coaches — Erik Spoelstra and Tyronn Lue, both of whom won NBA titles with James on their squads.\n\n\n\n\n“I was blown away by how hard he practices,” U.S. coach Steve Kerr said. “I went to Ty and Spo, and I said, ‘Is this normal?’ And they said, ‘Every day, every day.’ And then I said to Spo, ‘What about way back when you got him?’ And Spo said, ‘Every day, every drill, every walkthrough.’”\n\nKerr has coached against James in four NBA Finals, all of which featured Golden State guard Stephen Curry — who plays for Kerr with the Warriors and is making his Olympic debut this summer.\n\nAnd it’s fair to say that teaming up was part of what intrigued James and Curry when it was time to decide whether to play in Paris or not.\n\n“I’ve talked to both of them about this idea of being together after going against one another with such high stakes over the years,” Kerr said. “They obviously fit really well together. The idea of Steph playing off the ball, and LeBron pushing it in transition, that’s pretty intriguing. Obviously, Steph will play on the ball as well. And LeBron has become such a good shooter, but they’re both so good at so many different areas of the game. I think they’re really excited to compete together for the first time”\n\nJames was part of the U.S. teams that won bronze at the 2004 Olympics in Athens and the 2006 world championships (now called the World Cup) in Japan. And ever since then, the Americans have gone unbeaten when James is wearing USA across his chest in international play.\n\nStarting with the bronze medal game in Japan 18 years ago, the U.S. has played 36 games — 10 at the FIBA Americas tournament in 2007, then four exhibitions before and eight games at the 2008 Beijing Games, then five more exhibitions and eight games at the 2012 London Games — with James in uniform. The record: 36-0. He hopes it’s 47-0 when this summer’s run ends.\n\n“I’m here to have a good summer,” James said.\n\nEven after not playing in Rio de Janeiro or Tokyo, James will be participating in his fourth Olympics — tying the record for the most by any U.S. men’s player. Only Carmelo Anthony has played in four Olympics for the U.S. men to this point; Kevin Durant will play in his fourth this summer as well.\n\nThat’s a nice side note, but not the thing James is thinking about these days.\n\n“Our only goal,” he said, “is to win a gold medal.”\n\n___\n\nAP Summer Olympics: https://apnews.com/hub/2024-paris-olympic-games\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCopyright 2025 The Associated Press.

An eight-year NBA veteran, Saric has played with five teams, most recently averaging 8.0 points, 4.4 rebounds and 2.3 assists for the Golden State Warriors last season.\n\nSaric, 30, has also reprised his national team role this summer at Croatia’s FIBA Olympic Qualifying Tournament. He registered a 19-point triple-double in a group stage win over Slovenia last week, while Nuggets general manager Calvin Booth was in attendance for the tournament in Piraeus, Greece.\n\nAfter defeating the Dominican Republic on Saturday, Croatia will face Giannis Antetokounmpo and the Greek national team in Sunday’s final with a spot in the 2024 Paris Olympics on the line.\n\nSix days after the beginning of the NBA’s free agency moratorium period, Denver was one of the last remaining teams that hadn’t acquired a new player yet this offseason. Part of the delay with Saric was his own dilemma. The Nuggets viewed him as a top-priority target, but he was in the process of deciding whether he wanted to play in the NBA or Europe next season, according to a league source. Multiple NBA teams showed interest in him, as well as the Greek club Panathinaikos. Denver, a source said, felt confident about Saric even while other free agents were taken off the board throughout last week.\n\nSaric spent two years under contract with the Turkish club Anadolu Efes after he was drafted 12th overall in 2014. When he finally debuted with Philadelphia, he finished second in NBA Rookie of the Year voting for the 2016-17 season. He has played stints with the 76ers, Timberwolves, Suns, Thunder and Warriors.\n\nIn 2016, Saric was on the Croatian Olympic squad that got eliminated by Nikola Jokic and Serbia in the Rio de Janeiro quarterfinals. Now Saric is coming to Denver to contribute to a crowded frontcourt behind Jokic. He joins a center depth chart that currently includes Zeke Nnaji and DaRon Holmes II.\n\nNnaji has been in and out of the rotation for his entire four-year career, so Nuggets coach Michael Malone and the front office may envision Saric as a more reliable veteran option to play small-ball center with the second unit. And Booth has made clear that he views the first-round draft pick Holmes as more of a four than a five — one key reason the Nuggets still saw it necessary to pursue another bench big in the free agent market. They can also lean on positional size more if Holmes plays the four and Peyton Watson is able to play the three, his more natural fit.\n\nSaric should provide another floor-spacing option for Denver’s second unit. Since returning from an ACL injury that sidelined him for the 2021-22 season, he has made 38.1% of his 3-point attempts the last two years.\n\nIf the Nuggets bring back frontcourt free agents Vlatko Cancar and DeAndre Jordan, the acquisition of Saric will leave them with one roster spot left. Backup point guard is their biggest remaining need. Denver has shown interest in Russell Westbrook as a possible solution at that position behind Jamal Murray, according to a league source.\n\nWestbrook is under contract with the Clippers after picking up his $4 million player option in June, but the team is reportedly looking for trade partners or could buy out his contract. The Nuggets no longer have their taxpayer mid-level exception after signing Saric, but that doesn’t rule out a Westbrook move.\n\nWithin the frontcourt, Saric is likely to push Jordan farther out of the rotation next season. Jordan alternated with Nnaji at backup center in 2023-24, but assuming he returns to Denver for his age-36 season, his role will be more centered on locker room leadership.\n\nWant more Nuggets news?

But above and beyond that, Matty, it's disrespectful.'\n\nCampbell had also riled up the American swimming team by calling them 'sore losers', but Magnussen believes Stefanovic had escalated the war.\n\n'You can imagine if we were sitting back here in Australia and an American pundit off a talk show just absolutely ripped into Ian Thorpe, called him a tosser, said that he needs to lay off the bongs, said that he won't be watching the swimming, he'll be watching SpongeBob SquarePants, said that he presents terribly, has a bad haircut, Looks like a dead shit basically,' Magnussen said.\n\n'Americans don't know who Karl Stefanovic is. They don't know what tone he's saying it in. They don't understand the Today Show. They have never heard of Karl Stefanovic in their life.\n\nOlympian James Magnussen (pictured) thinks Karl Stefanovic went too far with his remarks about swimming legend Michael Phelps\n\nKarl Stefanovic labelled Phelps an 'absolute tosser' in a June segment on the Today Show\n\n'All they know is this guy on Australian television has absolutely ripped into a sporting icon to a guy that I believe is the greatest athlete of all time.\n\n'I'm slightly biased because I come from swimming, but there's an argument to be made that he is the greatest athlete of all time. He's the greatest Olympian of all time.'\n\nStefanovic referenced a controversial photo of Phelps holding a marijuana pipe from 2009 in his Today show segment.\n\n'Well he's angry he doesn't have a proper haircut,' the TV host said.\n\n'Also, I just feel like he's lost his personality. And they say that excessive bucket bombing does that to you.'\n\nStefanovic continued to take aim at the swimming great.\n\nMagnussen believes the inflammatory remarks about Phelps (pictured) were disrespectful \n\n'Phelpsy's just lost his personality hasn't he? He's just gone soft or something,' he said.\n\n'He's boring and he's retired. I want to say this to you, you have our full backing. The country is behind you to not back down. We want you to go forward.\n\n'I mean Phelpsy's probably not going to watch the swimming. He'll probably be watching SpongeBob SquarePants at three in the morning. You know what I mean, rather than be participating in all this.'\n\nMagnussen said he doesn't mind rivalry but believes the remarks from Stefanovic toward the swimming legend were disrespectful. \n\n'I'm all for creating a stir, and I'm all for banter between athletes when it's the athlete that then has to go and back it up,' Magnussen said.\n\n'So, for example, you know, in 2012, I had the famous line, 'brace yourselves', but guess who then has to go and back that up? I do. I'm the one that's standing behind those words.\n\n'To come from the sidelines, to come from the rafters and shoot down an icon of the country. An icon of the sport, an icon of the Olympics.\n\n'It just felt disrespectful and the manner it was done to call him a tosser.\n\n'That's verbatim. Called him a tosser. That's just not how you treat sporting greats.\n\n'It's not how you treat people in general, but certainly it's not how you treat a legend of the Olympics.'\n\n\n\t    Share what you think\n          \n\nThe comments below have not been moderated.\n\n\n      The views expressed in the contents above are those of our users and do not necessarily reflect the views of MailOnline.\n    \n\nWe are no longer accepting comments on this article.\n\nPublished by Associated Newspapers Ltd\n\nPart of the Daily Mail, The Mail on Sunday & Metro Media Group"

The Paris Olympics will be the 37-year-old’s last event before retirement.\n\nRaducanu practiced on Saturday morning with strapping on her right wrist and, just after 2pm, released a statement saying: ‘Unfortunately I woke up with some stiffness in my right wrist this morning, so I have decided to make the very tough decision to withdraw from the mixed doubles tonight. I’m disappointed as I was really looking forward to playing with Andy but got to take care.’\n\nShe is due to play her fourth-round singles match against New Zealand’s Lulu Sun tomorrow, and there is no suggestion her wrist injury will rule her out of that match.\n\nThe Murray camp is understood to be disappointed by the decision. Murray’s mother Judy — unwisely — described it on Twitter/X as ‘astonishing’. As Wimbledon has a trial of an AI system to track online trolling of players, it seems reckless for Judy Murray to risk causing a pile-on of abuse towards a 21-year-old woman.\n\nAndy Murray's Wimbledon career is over after Emma Raducanu's mixed doubles withdrawal\n\nThe British duo had been set to compete together but Raducanu (right) has pulled out due to wrist soreness but is due to play her fourth round singles match\n\nThe news of Emma Raducanu's withdrawal from the mixed doubles caught the attention of Judy Murray, who called the decision 'astonishing' on social media\n\nIt seems reckless for Judy Murray to risk causing a pile-on of abuse towards Raducanu\n\nRaducanu will doubtless feel guilty about denying Murray a final fling at Wimbledon\n\nIt is an unfortunate situation and Raducanu will doubtless feel guilty about denying Murray a final fling, but the brutal reality in this sport is you have to take care of yourself. Raducanu’s match against the world No123 for a place in the quarter-finals of Wimbledon is a massive opportunity.\n\nRaducanu had surgery on her right wrist last year and one only has to look at Juan Martin del Potro, Dominic Thiem or — more parochially — Laura Robson for evidence of how persistent wrist problems can wreck a career.\n\nNo one appreciates better than Murray the importance of protecting one’s body — or the fact that ruthlessness is not an optional trait for a career at the highest level.\n\nHe was 20 years old himself when he withdrew from a Davis Cup match in Argentina, citing knee pain, and even his brother Jamie joined in the criticism, saying: ‘It kind of affects the way I feel about him.’\n\nFor Raducanu and her team, the late scheduling of the mixed match — fourth on No1 Court — was doubtless a factor in their decision.\n\nAn 11pm finish — not out of the question — would have been awful preparation for a singles match the next day. Raducanu said herself the scheduling was ‘not ideal’. So as the tennis world looked for someone to blame, some turned on the All England Club. But a look at the permutations revealed they had little choice. \n\nWith rain curtailing play this week there is pressure to play singles matches before doubles, and one of Murray-Raducanu’s scheduled opponents, Marcelo Arevalo, was finishing his men’s doubles match yesterday morning, so they could hardly ask him to go back-to-back.\n\nRaducanu was asked after her second-round win whether she had any hesitation in agreeing to play mixed doubles with Murray. ‘For me it was a no-brainer,’ she replied.\n\nThe names of Murray and Raducanu are removed from the order of play at Wimbledon today after her decision to pull out with a wrist injury\n\nThe saving grace is Wimbledon decided to stage Murray's farewell after his men's doubles \n\n‘In my team, they were asking me, “Emma, are you sure you want to play? Just in case you’re still in the tournament?” I was like “No-brainer”.’\n\nSo there was clearly some uncertainty in her team about the prospect of her playing three days in a row, even before the wrist pain. But can anyone blame Raducanu for jumping at the chance to be part of Murray’s Wimbledon swansong? She felt she could not turn down an opportunity to create memories which, she said, she would remember when she was 70 years old.\n\nThe saving grace is that Wimbledon decided to stage Murray’s grand farewell after his men’s doubles, rather than waiting for the mixed. When we look back on Murray’s final Wimbledon, we will not remember the mixed doubles that never was. We will remember the tearful conversation with Sue Barker on Centre Court and that extended embrace with brother Jamie as the day’s last light died away.\n\n\n\t    Share what you think\n          \n\nThe comments below have not been moderated.\n\n\n      The views expressed in the contents above are those of our users and do not necessarily reflect the views of MailOnline.\n    \n\nWe are no longer accepting comments on this article.\n\nPublished by Associated Newspapers Ltd\n\nPart of the Daily Mail, The Mail on Sunday & Metro Media Group"

The team plays its first exhibition on Wednesday against Canada, then leaves Thursday for nearly five weeks abroad — going first to Abu Dhabi for two games, then to London for two more games, then finally to Paris for the Olympics.\n\nThe 26-year-old Tatum — one of two Celtics on this U.S. team, along with Jrue Holiday — is seeking his second Olympic gold medal, after being part of the team that won at the Tokyo Games held three years ago. Tatum averaged 15.2 points for the Americans in those Olympics, second on the team behind Kevin Durant’s 20.7 points per game.\n\nThe Olympics will be the capper of a busy few months for Tatum. The five-time All-Star helped the Celtics win their first NBA title since 2008 last month — then started his offseason by agreeing to a league-record $314 million, five-year extension that could keep him in Boston through the 2029-30 season.\n\nThat contract was finalized Saturday, the first day that such a deal could be executed by NBA rule.\n\n“Jayson is a special person and player, and it’s been a thrill for all of us to watch his entire journey in Boston,” Celtics President Brad Stevens said Saturday in a release distributed by the team. “He has embraced all that comes with being a great Celtic, and shows consistent and genuine care for every one of his teammates, coaches, and staff across the organization.\n\n\n\n\nTatum averaged 26.9 points, 8.1 rebounds and 4.9 assists per game this past season for the Celtics, and has averaged 23.1 points, 7.2 rebounds and 3.5 assists in his first seven NBA seasons.\n\nTatum was in Las Vegas for most of the week prior to the start of the U.S. camp, hosting his own elite camp for select high school and college players. Fellow U.S. Olympian Bam Adebayo was also part of that camp, as were fellow NBA players Paolo Banchero and Chris Paul.\n\n___\n\nAP Summer Olympics: https://apnews.com/hub/2024-paris-olympic-games\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCopyright 2025 The Associated Press.

(AP Photo: Kirsty Wigglesworth)\n\nSeven-time champion Novak Djokovic shrugged off a slow start to power past unseeded Australian Alexei Popyrin 4-6 6-3 6-4 7-6(3) and into the fourth round of Wimbledon on Saturday.\n\nThe Serb's bid for a record-extending 25th grand slam title looked like it might be under threat when Popyrin took a 4-3 lead with a blistering crosscourt forehand winner and sealed the opening set with a second-serve ace.\n\nBut normal service was soon resumed.\n\nAppearing rejuvenated after the roof was closed, Djokovic went up 4-1 in the second set, when fans erupted on Centre Court as news trickled in that England had beaten Switzerland to make the Euro 2024 semi-finals.\n\nThe amused second seed simulated a penalty kick that Popyrin pretended to save, to the delight of fans.\n\nDjokovic had little trouble in the second and third sets, but faced a bit more resistance in the fourth as Popyrin dug deep in search of his first win in the pair's third clash, saving three breakpoints to hold in the 11th game.\n\nAfter ensuring a tiebreak, however, Djokovic switched on the after-burners to close out the win, finishing with a fiery serve that Popyrin could only send crashing back into the net.\n\nIga Świątek has not found success easy on grass. (AP Photo: Alberto Pezzali)\n\nAfter putting one shot into the net, Iga Świątek muttered to herself. After another point went awry, she placed her hand over her mouth. Generally, she looked as flustered as she ever does on a tennis court.\n\nOnce again, she went from unbeatable on the French Open's red clay to underwhelming on Wimbledon's green grass.\n\nThe number one-ranked Świątek's 21-match winning streak ended with a listless performance and a slew of mistakes on Saturday, adding up to a 3-6, 6-1, 6-2 loss to unseeded Yulia Putintseva in the third round at the All England Club.\n\n\"Going from this kind of tennis, where I felt like I'm playing the best tennis in my life, to another surface, where I kind of struggle a little bit more, it's not easy,\" said Świątek, who only once has made it as far as the quarterfinals at Wimbledon, exiting at that stage a year ago. \n\nNever does. In 2022, for example, her 37-match unbeaten run was stopped with another third-round loss at the All England Club, that one to Alize Cornet.\n\nŚwiątek, a 23-year-old from Poland, is a five-time grand slam champion, including four titles at Roland Garros — most recently last month — and one on the hard courts at the US Open. \n\nShe has talked about looking forward to improving on grass, but she decided to withdraw last month from the only tune-up event that was originally on her schedule before Wimbledon.\n\n\"My tank of really pushing myself to the limits became, suddenly, empty,\" Świątek said. \"I was kind of surprised.\"\n\nAlexander Zverev did not think his knee injury was serious.

I do feel restricted on some of the movements but I will check and see what it is but I'm pleased I was able to play the way that I did. If I'd dropped in my level I would have had no chance against Cam.\"\n\nZverev has bitter memories of injuries ending grand slam challenges, notably at the 2022 French Open when he had to be taken off court on a wheelchair during his semi-final against Rafa Nadal, having sustained serious ankle damage.\n\nSpeaking to reporters later he sounded confident that this knee injury was not too serious.\n\n\"If you're breaking a ligament or breaking something else, the meniscus or something like that, I don't think you can continue playing even the way I did, hopefully I'll be fine in two days' time,\" he said.\n\nAndy Murray will not walk through the halls of Wimbeldon as a player again. (AP Photo: Alberto Pezzali)\n\nAndy Murray's Wimbledon career came to an anticlimactic end when Emma Raducanu, his mixed doubles partner, pulled out of that competition hours before their first-round match on Saturday because of an issue with her surgically repaired right wrist.\n\nThe 37-year-old Murray, a two-time singles champion at the All England Club, has said he will head into retirement after competing at Wimbledon and the Paris Olympics, which start later this month.\n\nMixed doubles was supposed to be the last event at the grass-court grand slam tournament for Murray, who withdrew from singles because of an operation to remove a cyst from his spine on June 22, and then exited in the first round of men's doubles alongside his older brother, Jamie.\n\n\"Unfortunately I woke up with some stiffness in my right wrist this morning, so therefore I have decided to make the very tough decision to withdraw from the mixed doubles tonight,\" Raducanu said. \n\n\"I'm disappointed as I was really looking forward to playing with Andy but got to take care.\"\n\nAmerican Ben Shelton claimed another five-set victory at Wimbledon this week, winning 6-7 (4), 6-2, 6-4, 4-6, 6-2 against Denis Shapovalov.\n\nIt was the 21-year-old American's third consecutive five-set win, the first player to do that at Wimbledon since Ernests Gulbis in 2018.\n\nNo man in the Open era (which dates to 1968) has ever won four matches in a row in five sets at any major tournament.\n\nABC Sport Daily is your daily sports conversation. We dive into the biggest story of the day and get you up to speed with everything else that's making headlines.\n\nThere already have been 33 five-set matches through one week of play, the most ever at any slam in the Open era. \n\nThe most for an entire tournament in that span is 35.\n\nShapovalov chalked that up to there being talent spread around the tour and few grass-court experts. \n\nShelton said he loves that matches can go that long.\n\n\"There's a lot of things I appreciate about five sets,\" Shelton said. \n\n\"The amount of time you are out there on the court, it's a physical test. You have to be ready to go the distance and you have to be fit and in shape\n\n\"There's also a lot of time for guys to make adjustments, so you can't just really blow a guy off the court in one way.

It said Russians had qualified up to 16 spots for the Paris Olympics, not 10, and that six of those invited were “far from the status of Russian team leaders.” The federation listed the names of top Russian wrestlers who didn’t get invitations and said the Olympic event would now be devalued.\n\n“Any sane person understands that the status of the Olympic Games as the most significant sporting event is being questioned, and wrestling competitions without Russian athletes will be incomplete, and the champions will not receive the satisfaction of winning the Olympic tournament,” the statement said.\n\nThe IOC previously said it would only issue invitations to Russian and Belarusian athletes who do not have ties to the security services or military, and who have not publicly supported the war. They would compete in neutral uniforms and would not compete under the national flag.\n\n\n\nSome Russian athletes and officials have favored competing at the Paris Olympics under those conditions, and others have called for boycotts. The wrestling federation had sent athletes to take part in qualifying competitions, unlike some other Russian sports bodies.\n\nLast week, the Russian judo federation said its board had decided not to send any athletes to Paris. Its statement didn't specify what its athletes thought. The IOC told The Associated Press in an e-mailed statement Tuesday that it was waiting for an “individual reply” from the judo athletes. The IOC website lists one Russian competitor in judo as having accepted an invitation.\n\nAs of Sunday, the IOC website listed 23 Russian athletes in seven sports who it said had accepted invitations for the Paris Olympics, including the wrestlers. The 2021 U.S. Open champion Daniil Medvedev is among six tennis players who the IOC says have accepted."

The player with the lowest number of strokes at the end of the four rounds is named the winner.\n\nThe competition is limited to 60 athletes, who are selected based on their world golf ranking. Athletes who are positioned in the top 15 in the world rankings automatically qualify for the event. After the top 15, each country is eligible to select two athletes to compete providing they do not have more than four representatives in the top 10. \n\nLydia Ko (L) and Jason Day (R) with the Grant Thornton Invitational trophy. Getty\n\nJason Day and Kiwi Lydia Ko claimed victory in a historic mixed-teams event last year as the top-ranked male Aussie golfer issued a plea for the event to be added to the season calendar. \n\nWith the PGA Tour and LPGA Tour rarely crossing paths in the current competition schedule, many who competed at the Grant Thornton Invitational expressed their desire to see the team event played again. \n\nFor Australia's star sibling duo Min Woo Lee and Minjee Lee, who did not compete at the mixed team event in Florida, the program in Paris will likely mean they will be unable to watch each other's event.\n\nHowever, the inclusion of a mixed team event would likely ensure both competitions cross paths.\n\n\"I've only thought about it a little bit recently,\" Minjee said of the proposed team event.\n\nMinjee Lee (R) and Min Woo Lee (L). Getty\n\n\"It seems like they are trying to incorporate some sort of teams event [in Los Angeles], which means we have to play two extra days on top of our regular tournament. I'm not sure how they're going to do it.\n\n\"I do think with the nature of the Olympics that they should have some sort of team event, if they could incorporate it without having too much strain on the players.\n\n\"I'd love for there to be a mixed team event but I don't know how they would fit it in... I'm not sure how I feel about it to be honest.\"\n\nMin Woo jokingly interjected Minjee, stating: \"Wow, just say you don't want to play with me.\"\n\nMin Woo was open to the proposed format that would see him team up with his sister on the global stage as he prepares to compete in his first Olympic Games in Paris.\n\n\"It would be special if we could play together,\" he said.\n\n\"It will make a big difference playing an extra two days and I guess prep wise it will be tough without a practice round with each other because if we have (our singles competition ) at different times.\n\n\"I think it will be cool even if it's just one day to showcase who the best doubles partners are. That would be very special.\n\n\"There's a lot of questions around it... Does that mean the guys have to play earlier? The women play after (the men's competition) but when would the doubles be? Will it be the week after?\n\n\"I'm sure there would be a lot of input with players and the committee.\"\n\nCurrently at an Olympic level, six of the 32 nations who are scheduled to compete in Paris do not have two representatives in the men's competition to take part in a mixed event. In the women's competition, eight of 34 nations have only one representative.\n\nBut two-time LPGA Tour winner and Aussie Olympian Hannah Green offered an easy solution for the imbalance.\n\n\"I think it would be great to have the men and women combined (in teams),\" Green said. \n\nHannah Green plays her shot from the fourth tee in Tokyo at the 2020 Olympic Games. Getty\n\n\"If that is too hard, just to have a team score versus just an individual (score). If someone's maybe not doing too well, having (the opportunity) for someone else to pick them up would be cool.\n\nHowever, Green noted it would be \"logistically difficult\" to introduce the event to the Olympic schedule.\n\n\"It would just be logistically difficult (at the Olympics) because not every country has two representatives,\" she said. \n\n\"It would be nice to be more involved with each other in an individual sport, to make it a bit more team-like.\n\n\"It will be interesting to see what they do in LA in 2028 and Brisbane in 2032.\"\n\nAustralia's Olympic golf team will hit the fairways from August 1.\n\n9 minutes ago\n\n38 minutes ago\n\n1 hour ago\n\n© 2025 Nine Entertainment Co."

        "expanded content": "This isn’t the same Fever team that the Liberty crushed, 104-68, just over a month ago. \n\nIt’s not the same one that had its home opener — which doubled as Caitlin Clark’s regular-season debut at Gainbridge Fieldhouse — spoiled by the superteam, or that lost by a combined 83 points in their three meetings this season.\n\nThe players haven’t changed. \n\nThere wasn’t any firing, either. \n\nWhen Liberty coach Sandy Brondello spoke with Christie Sides, she told the Fever head coach, “You just gotta go through the process now. This is a new team.” \n\nIt would take time, just as it did for the Liberty in 2023. \n\nAnd at some point, a juncture impossible to predict, everything would start to mesh.\n\nSince the last Liberty-Fever matchup June 2, Indiana has crawled back into playoff conversations with a 6-4 run entering Saturday’s game in Indianapolis. \n\nSome of that connects back to Clark, averaging 16.0 points, 7.1 assists and 5.7 rebounds. \n\nBrondello and Breanna Stewart said the Fever’s post players — as well as Clark’s ability to orchestrate the offense alongside them — have contributed to their about-face, too, which adds a layer of complexity to the Liberty’s quest to sweep the season series.\n\n“They’re a way tougher team now than they were in the beginning,” Brondello said.\n\nOver the last 10 games, the Fever’s offensive rating sits tied for third in the WNBA — behind just the Aces and Liberty — after possessing the second-worst number across their first three weeks of the season. \n\nAliyah Boston and NaLyssa Smith have nearly averaged double-doubles (15.5 points and 9.7 rebounds along with 11.5 and 8.5, respectively) during that stretch. \n\nGuard Kelsey Mitchell (16.6 points per game) leveraged her strong first half into an All-Star Game appearance, too.\n\nThere have still been losses and defensive growing pains, but the Fever’s strides have been concrete.\n\n“We’ve seen them three times already,” Stewart said Thursday. “Obviously know that each time they’ve gotten a little bit better, but still using what we do defensively to kind of impose our will.”\n\nThat, as always, will start with Betnijah Laney-Hamilton, who helped limit Clark to nine points and three points, respectively, in two of the games. \n\nBut for about six minutes Tuesday, in the third quarter of their win against the Lynx, the Liberty encountered a scare when Laney-Hamilton’s leg tangled with Napheesa Collier and she eventually limped toward the bench.\n\nLaney-Hamilton returned to play nearly the entire fourth quarter, and in the Liberty’s practice Thursday she was a full participant, Brondello said.\n\nSaturday will also mark the first game since the All-Star participants were announced and Laney-Hamilton — whom Brondello vouched for in a press conference Tuesday — wasn’t one of them. \n\nBrondello messaged her to “just use it as motivation.” \n\nLaney-Hamilton didn’t need to change anything, Brondello said. \n\nNothing would change about her role as the Liberty’s defensive anchor, either.\n\nBut it’s fitting that the Clark matchup will be Laney-Hamilton’s first following the All-Star roster getting announced. \n\nLaney-Hamilton finished plus-43 on May 16. \n\nAnd since they last met, Clark nearly recorded her first WNBA triple-double. \n\nThere was the debate about wanting Clark to be more aggressive, about Clark playing Diana Taurasi and then beating her role model. \n\nThere was Clark getting left off the Team USA roster for the 2024 Olympics. \n\nThere was Clark making the Team WNBA roster for the All-Star Game.\n\nSuch is five weeks in the Caitlin Clark news cycle.\n\nBut that time frame has also coincided with the Fever’s starting to reverse their season’s spiraling trajectory. \n\nEverything has clicked for them — and it involves more than just Clark. \n\nThe individual pieces have started to fall into place.\n\n“And that,” Brondello said, “always takes time. That’s chemistry.”\n\n\n\nAdvertisement"

It means the football will get BBC 1 billing while Raducanu and Murray will be on the second channel.\n\nRaducanu is teaming up with Murray for his Wimbledon farewell. The 37-year-old is set to retire at the Olympics later this summer and has already confirmed that this will be his final appearance at SW19.\n\nHe pulled out of the singles draw but played the men's doubles with his brother Jamie. But they crashed out in the first round on Thursday night and Murray was subsequently honoured with a ceremony on Centre Court after the match. Their loss means that the former world No. 1 is guaranteed to play his last-ever Wimbledon match with Raducanu by his side.\n\nBut tournament organisers made an eyebrow-raising decision to schedule Murray's potential farewell last on the second show court, meaning that all of the attention will be on the football with the BBC showing England v Switzerland on Saturday evening. And Raducanu herself wasn't happy with the call when she came off court after her third-round singles match to see the order of play.\n\n  Just in    Wimbledon scoreboard malfunctions as BBC viewers left confused during Sinner tie  \n\nOur community members are treated to special offers, promotions, and adverts from us and our partners.

The scheduling of that was not ideal,\" Raducanu, who practised on-site in an England shirt earlier this week, said when asked what she made of playing at the same time as the football. \"I mean, it's just an amazing opportunity to be able to play with him. It's something that I'm going to cherish.\"\n\nThe 2021 US Open champion was also quizzed on whether she had any influence over the decision but she quickly put the responsibility on the tournament. \"No, I just came off court and found out myself,\" she replied.\n\nThe scheduling is far from ideal for Raducanu, who will have to return on Sunday for her fourth-round singles match against Lulu Sun - meaning she'll have very little time to recover in between matches.\n\n  Don't miss...

But they also had to factor in Raducanu's singles match and the rain delays that cancelled play on outside courts.\n\nHe explained: \"Andy and Emma will be on tomorrow’s schedule definitely, but whether they get on depends on what happens today and what court depends on what happens tomorrow. Obviously Emma is playing singles today so again, a bit will depend on what happens with that result. The things that we have to juggle is that with the football matches we know exactly what time they are but with tennis matches you don’t know exactly what time.\"\n\nAfter taking aim at the schedule, Raducanu ultimately withdrew from the mixed doubles on Saturday afternoon after waking up with a stiff wrist.

Like, coaches can't get on athletes and they have to be really careful what they say.\"\n\n\"Which, in some ways, is really good,\" she noted, \"but at the same time, to get to where you need to be in gymnastics you do have to be, I feel like, a little aggressive and a little intense.\"\n\nAnd although MyKayla has since apologized—saying on her Instagram Story July 3 that she's \"sorry for anything that got out of context or seemed hurtful\"—her comments have made an impact online.\n\nIn fact, former gymnast Vanessa Atler defended the team, writing on her Instagram July 4 that she's \"never seen so much depth\" in squad.\n\n\"The words that you said cannot be misinterpreted,\" Vanessa, the 1997 U.S. national all-around champion, wrote. \"They are just petty and mean. That's all there is to it. Maybe you should take a lesson from these Olympic athletes on how to be supportive and uplifting to other women.\"\n\nTo catch up with more former gymnasts ahead of the Olympics, keep reading...\n\nA pioneer in the sport, she was among the first female athletes to help popularize gymnastics in the nation, thanks to her strong performance at the 1968 Mexico City Games, although she never medaled. Rigby retired after the 1972 Olympics and is perhaps best known for playing the title role in the theatrical musical Peter Pan, which earned her a Tony Award nomination in 1991. \n\nShe has been a familiar face to not only theater fans but also TV viewers, due to serving for many years as an ABC Sports commentator, in addition to appearing on the series The Six Million Dollar Man. Rigby has also been open throughout the years about her previous battle with disordered eating. \n\nThe star and husband Tom McCoy share two children, and she has two children from a previous marriage.\n\nA defining cultural figure of the 1980s before retiring in 1986, she won five medals at the 1984 Los Angeles Games. Among those prizes was gold in the all-around, making her the first American woman to achieve this feat in the sport. She shares four children with her ex-husband, former University of Houston quarterback Shannon Kelley, who she split from in 2018. \n\nOutside of athletics, she became vocal in politics, supporting President Ronald Reagan along his 1984 reelection campaign trail and later speaking at the 2004 Republican National Convention. Retton made cameos in the films Scrooged and Naked Gun 33+1⁄3, and more recently, she became the first woman inducted into the Houston Sports Hall of Fame in 2020. \n\nThe retired athlete was hospitalized for severe pneumonia in 2023.\n\nShannon Miller\n\nWith a total of seven medals, won during the 1992 Barcelona Games and 1996 Atlanta Games, she became the most-awarded female Olympic gymnast in history before Simone Biles edged her out with her collection of eight medals. After failing to qualify for the 2020 Sydney Games, Miller turned her focus to her schooling, earning a business degree and later a law degree, although she never took the Bar Exam. \n\nMiller went on to appear in fitness videos, published the 2015 autobiography It's Not About Perfect and is an advocate for preventing childhood obesity. She and second husband John Falconetti share two children. \n\nKerri Strug\n\nShe is a two-time medalist best known for competing on the vault despite an ankle injury at the 1996 Atlanta Games and later being carried to the podium by coach Béla Károlyi. The memorable feat led to a whirlwind of media moments, including appearances on SNL and Beverly Hills, 90210, plus a visit with President Bill Clinton, and she retired shortly thereafter. \n\nStrug went on to become a schoolteacher and also got involved in politics, including speaking at the 2004 Republican National Convention. Her memoir, Landing On My Feet, A Diary Of Dreams, is in development as a feature film from director Olivia Wilde, with Thomasin McKenzie attached to play the athlete. \n\nShe and husband Robert Fischer share two children. \n\nShe competed in the 1992 Barcelona Games, 1996 Atlanta Games and 2000 Sydney Games, winning four medals. This includes the team gold in 1996, making her the first Black gymnast of any nationality to win a gold medal.\n\nDawes retired after the Sydney Games.

Thursday's tilt between Georgia and the Philippines just saw perhaps one of the most bizarre endings ever in a basketball game.\n\nWatch the sequence below, via Blake (@blakesilverman) on X/Twitter:\n\nIf you're confused about what happened, here is a breakdown as to why Georgia, who was up by two points, tried to tie the game and send it into overtime.\n\nIn an effort to keep their semi-finals hopes alive, Georgia big man and Orlando Magic center Goga Bitadze attempted to purposely score on the Philippines' basket to force overtime. Bitadze, however, fumbled on what should have been an easy putback attempt. They ironically won the game, 96-94, but lost their bid to qualify for the Olympics. \n\nBut why did Bitadze try to tie the game even though they were on the way to the win? \n\nAfter getting blown out, 88-53, against Latvia, Georgia needed to win by at least 19 points to advance to the semi-final round of the tournament due to the quotient system. However, they found themselves just up by two points after Gilas Pilipinas guard Chris Newsome missed his second freethrow with just 2.8 seconds remaining.\n\nGoing into overtime would have given Georgia a long-shot chance of trying to keep their semi-final hopes alive. But even if Bitadze had made the basket, they still had a steep mountain to climb as they would have needed to outscore the Philippines by 19 points in the five-minute extra session.\n\nGeorgia established a 40-20 lead at one point early in the second quarter. They raced out to a 16-0 lead in the first quarter before Gilas Pilipinas got on the board with 4:50 remaining in the period. \n\nAfter a stunning victory over No. 6 Latvia on Wednesday, the Philippines showcased its resiliency and put together a spirited comeback in the second half. Gilas Pilipinas outscored Georgia 31-19 in the third quarter before the final frame saw a tense back-and-forth between the two semi-final hopefuls.\n\nIn the end, Georgia won the game, but the Philippines marched forward thanks to their valiant effort. Gilas Pilipinas head coach Tim Cone hilariously admitted that he was surprised about how the tournament unfolded for his team.\n\nIn fact, he also revealed they had already booked their flights back home. Nonetheless, he praised his troops' resiliency over the last couple of games.\n\n\"This is the first time I've felt good about losing -- really just want to compliment our guys. They went down (by) 20 and it could easily have been panic time, and they worked their way back into the game.\" - Tim Cone\n\nJustin Brownlee led the way for the Philippines with 28 points, eight rebounds, and eight assists, while guard Dwight Ramos finished with 16 points and five rebounds. Georgia was led by former San Antonio Spurs forward Sandro Mamukelashvili, who scored 26 points, while Bitadze added 21 points and 11 rebounds.\n\nThe hype surrounding Cooper Flagg is real and USA Basketball recognizes it.\n\nWe want to hear from you!

Trimetazidine has the potential to boost endurance and has been banned by the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) since 2014. But the agency decided the swimmers were not responsible for the results because they were inadvertently exposed to the drug.\n    \n\n\n            In May, the US House select committee on China asked the FBI and the Justice Department to launch an investigation into the case under a 2020 law that allows for the criminal prosecution of people who help athletes dope at international competitions, even if they didn’t happen in the United States.\n    \n\n\n            “We can’t comment on the reported federal law enforcement investigation,” Travis Tygart, the CEO of the US Anti-Doping Agency, said in a statement to CNN Thursday.\n    \n\n\n            “The Rodchenkov Anti-Doping Act was enacted in 2021 with broad athlete, sport, and multinational governmental support because WADA could not be trusted to be a strong, fair global watchdog to protect clean athletes and fair sport,” Tygart said.\n    \n\n\n            In his statement, Tygart, who has blamed WADA and China’s doping watchdog (CHINADA) for covering up the positive tests, implied that WADA officials were afraid to travel to the US out of concern they would face questions from law enforcement.\n    \n\n\n            In a news conference earlier this year, WADA President Witold Bańka said the agency “followed all due processes and diligently investigated every lead and line of enquiry in this matter” and found “no evidence of wrongdoing … and no credible way to disprove the contamination theory that was accepted by CHINADA.”\n    \n\n\n            WADA was notified of the positive tests in June 2021, roughly a month before the Tokyo Games kicked off.\n    \n\n\n            CNN has reached out to the Department of Justice and WADA for comment on the news about the investigation.\n    \n\n© 2025 Cable News Network.

(AP Photo: Charlie Riedel, file)\n\nWorld Aquatics has confirmed its executive director has been subpoenaed by the US government to testify in an investigation into doping cases of 23 Chinese swimmers.\n\nThe swimmers tested positive for trimetazidine in January 2021, but WADA accepted that traces of the substance were found in the kitchen at the team's hotel.\n\nThe Paris Olympics, which begin on July 26, will see 11 of the swimmers who tested positive in 2021 set to compete.\n\nThe international swimming federation says its top administrator has been ordered to testify as a witness in a US criminal investigation into the case of 23 Chinese swimmers who failed doping tests in 2021 yet were allowed to continue competing.\n\nThe news comes just three weeks before the Paris Olympics, where 11 of the Chinese swimmers who tested positive for the banned heart medication three years ago are set to compete.\n\nThe swimmers won three gold medals for China at the 2021 Tokyo Olympics, just weeks after the World Anti-Doping Agency declined to challenge Chinese authorities' explanation of food contamination at a hotel to justify not suspending them.\n\nThose decisions, which World Aquatics separately reached also, were not revealed until reporting in April by the New York Times and German broadcaster ARD.\n\nA House Committee on China asked the Justice Department and the FBI on May 21 to investigate the case under a federal law that allows probes into suspected doping conspiracies even if they occurred outside the US.\n\nHead coach Rohan Taylor says Australia's Olympic swimmers have to trust WADA and that his team \"can only control what we can control\" after another alleged positive test is reported.\n\n\"World Aquatics can confirm that its executive director, Brent Nowicki, was served with a witness subpoena by the United States government,\" the federation said in a statement to AP.\n\n\"He is working to schedule a meeting with the government, which, in all likelihood will obviate the need for testimony before a Grand Jury.\"\n\nWorld Aquatics declined to answer questions about where and when Nowicki was served his subpoena and didn't say which office was handling the investigation.\n\n\"Per our standard practice, the FBI does not confirm nor deny the existence of an investigation,\" the bureau said in an email reply.\n\nThe Chinese swimmers case could become the highest-profile use so far of a US federal law passed in 2020 in fallout from the long-running scandal of Russian state-backed doping in sports.\n\nThe 23 swimmers tested positive for trimetazidine in January 2021 and those were filed weeks later in the global anti-doping database.\n\nThey included Zhang Yufei, who went on take Olympic gold in the women's 200-metre butterfly and 4x200 freestyle relay, and Wang Shun, the men's 200 medley champion.\n\nA later investigation by Chinese state authorities said traces of the substance were found in the kitchen of a hotel where the team stayed.\n\nNo explanation has been given about how and why the drug prescribed in pill form got there.\n\nWADA accepted the theory, which allowed the Chinese swimmers to continue to compete, and has since described it as \"a relatively straightforward case of mass contamination\".\n\nThe agency has since defended its handling of the case that was kept secret in 2021, saying it had no way to independently disprove the theory during the COVID-19 pandemic when travel to China was not possible.\n\nLawyers for WADA said in April this year they did not have evidence to win separate appeals against the 23 swimmers before the Tokyo Olympics.\n\nAny appeals seeking suspensions for the swimmers would have been heard at the Court of Arbitration for Sport, where Nowicki was a long-time senior counsel before joining World Aquatics in 2021.\n\n\"This scandal raises serious legal, ethical, and competitive concerns and may constitute a broader state-sponsored strategy by the People's Republic of China to unfairly compete at the Olympic Games in ways Russia has previously done,\" the Select Committee on the Chinese Communist Party said in the letter to the Justice Department and FBI.\n\nThe case was also raised at a congressional hearing last month in which swimming great Michael Phelps said athletes had lost faith in WADA as the global watchdog trying to keep cheaters out of sports.\n\nOfficials from the Montreal-based agency declined an invitation to come to the hearing, saying it would be \"inappropriate to be pulled into a political debate before a US congressional committee regarding a case from a different country, especially while an independent review into WADA's handling of the case is ongoing\".\n\nABC Sport is live blogging every day of the Paris Olympics\n\nABC Sport is live blogging every day of the Paris Olympics\n\nThat review report is pending from a WADA-appointed former public prosecutor in the Swiss canton of Vaud that is home to the International Olympic Committee and governing bodies of many Olympic sports.\n\nUS Anti-Doping Agency chief executive Travis Tygart suggested to The Associated Press an ongoing federal investigation could make sport officials travelling to the US \"fearful that they may have to answer questions about their activities from the FBI\".\n\nABC Sport Daily is your

It received broad support from the global sports world for its aims to criminalise doping.\n\nHowever, WADA lobbied against what it saw as a risk of overreach from the \"extraterritorial\" jurisdiction it could give to US federal agencies, and the IOC also voiced concerns.\n\nThe Rodchenkov Act, Tygart said, \"was enacted in 2021 with broad athlete, sport and multinational governmental support because WADA could not be trusted to be a strong, fair global watchdog to protect clean athletes and fair sport\".\n\nAP\n\nTopic:NRL\n\nTopic:Paralympic Games\n\nTopic:Sport\n\nTopic:Police\n\nTopic:State of Origin\n\nTopic:Health\n\nAnalysis by Patricia Karvelas\n\nTopic:Foreign Aid\n\nTopic:Alternative Energy\n\nTopic:Courts\n\nTopic:Swimming\n\nTopic:Sport\n\nTopic:Doping in Sports\n\nTopic:Sport\n\nChina\n\nDoping in Sports\n\nSport\n\nSwimming\n\nUnited States\n\nTopic:Health\n\nAnalysis by Patricia Karvelas\n\nTopic:Foreign Aid\n\nTopic:Alternative Energy\n\nTopic:Courts\n\nTopic:World War 2\n\nTopic:Children's Health\n\nTopic:Activism and Lobbying\n\nTopic:Indigenous Culture\n\nWe acknowledge Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples as the First Australians and Traditional Custodians of the lands where we live, learn, and work.\n\nThis service may include material from Agence France-Presse (AFP), APTN, Reuters, AAP, CNN and the BBC World Service which is copyright and cannot be reproduced.\n\nAEST = Australian Eastern Standard Time which is 10 hours ahead of GMT (Greenwich Mean Time)"

He put in a great effort and played very good tennis,” said the second seed, who played with his right knee strapped after undergoing surgery on a torn meniscus just a month ago.\r\n\n“This match potentially deserved to get into a fifth the way we both played, the way he played particularly in the fourth, but I’m very glad it didn’t.”\n\n\n                Comments\n            \n\n\n                    Wimbledon 2024\n                \n                        /                      \n                    \n\n\n                    Novak Djokovic\n                \n\nBACK TO TOP\n\nTerms & conditions  |  Institutional Subscriber\n\nComments have to be in English, and in full sentences.

Or even her C-game, for that matter, and as Wang’s crisp forehands found the lines and her own error-count started to rise, Pegula’s body language told the story of an increasingly anxious No 5 seed.\n\nWang carved out the first of no fewer than six breaks of the Pegula serve in game seven. The American saved the first two of three break points from love-40, but she could not cope with the pinpoint return on to the baseline on the third.\n\nWang then served for the set three games later, and while the Chinese player lost a nervous opening point, Pegula missed an excellent chance to apply some serious pressure, stabbing a tentative forehand into the net, and her opponent eventually served it out to 30.\n\nIn an odd opening to the second set both players took games in pairs, with four breaks of serve in all to 4-4, and while Pegula scrapped ferociously in the ninth, saving five break points, she was broken again in the 11th to leave her opponent serving for the match. Now it was Wang’s nerve that started to wobble and a double fault at 15-40 was a miserable way to let it slip.\n\nIt turned out to be an outstanding tie-break, swinging one way and then the other amid some thunderous shot-making on both sides of the net. A match point on the Wang serve came and went and Pegula dug deep to level at 1-1.\n\nHaving stood on the brink of a well-earned success, it could have been a turning point for Wang, but she simply returned to the heavy hitting of the first set and swiftly raced to 4-0. The nerves returned slightly as she served for the match for a second time, but from 15-40, Wang fought back to deuce and after saving a third break point, a thumping serve on her third match point set up a winning volley that was gratefully put away to complete a 6-4, 6-7 (7), 6-1 success.\n\nIn the same quarter, Ons Jabeur, the beaten finalist in 2022 and 2023, eased through to the third round with a 6-1, 7-5 defeat of Robin Montgomery, while Elena Rybakina, the champion in 2022 and seeded to meet Iga Swiatek, the No 1 seed, in the semis, dropped the second set against Laura Siegemund but eventually came through 6-3, 3-6, 6-3.\n\nJabeur has been struggling with a recurrent right knee injury for much of the past five years and said after her victory that she has now come to terms with playing through the pain.\n\n“I’ve just accepted that I will always have knee pain,” Jabeur said. “Maybe you see me running good on the court, but sometimes it’s tougher than other days.\n\n“It’s definitely part of me right now. I think a big part of it mentally is accepting that I’ll always have knee pain.\n\n“The scheduling and the amount of tournaments they are adding right now doesn’t really help. I’m really curious how players are going to play the Olympics and the hard court season. It’s going to be really tough.”\n\nSwiatek, meanwhile, reached the third round – in which she suffered a surprise elimination two years ago – with a routine defeat of Petra Martic on Centre Court, 6-4, 6-3."

We never got the chance to do it before. There was a chance this year.\n\n\"Jamie's usual partner was playing with Neal Skupski so he asked me. Obviously it was a bit of a race against time to try and get out here and physically it wasn't easy today but I'm glad we were able to get out here and do this one time together.\"\n\n Fans give Murray a standing ovation. Getty\n\nMurray became a superstar in these parts by winning Wimbledon in 2013, making him the first British man to triumph in singles at the All England Club in 77 years.\n\nHe won the title again in 2016. His other Grand Slam trophy came at the US Open in 2012, the same year he won his first singles gold medal at the London Olympics — the next, at Rio de Janeiro in 2016, made him the only player with two in a row.\n\n10 minutes ago\n\n38 minutes ago\n\n1 hour ago\n\n© 2025 Nine Entertainment Co."

He also talked about 'almost blowing his chance' with Kim, who he married in 2015, when he asked for her email address.\n\n'I don't remember much of that night,' he said. 'I had a few drinks. I did unfortunately vomit in the cab on the way home.'\n\nOn the first time Kim watched him live, at the 2005 US Open, he said: 'I vomited twice in that match, once right in front of where she was sitting and stood up and vomited on my opponent's racket bag.\n\n'But she still seemed to like me so I knew she was a keeper after that!'\n\nMurray spoke candidly about his Wimbledon triumphs, his Olympic gold and his defeat by Roger Federer in the 2012 final in his conversation with Barker.\n\n'It's always really difficult to speak after a loss, particularly after a Grand Slam final and being at Wimbledon,' he said on the loss to Federer.\n\nBarker joked she 'wasn't going to miss this' as she made a comeback to lead the tributes\n\nA host of tennis legends were on Centre Court to say goodbye to two-time champion Murray\n\nMurray shared a warm embrace with brother Jamie after their loss in the men's doubles event\n\n\"I knew she was a keeper\" @andy_murray talks about Kim's first experience of watching him play (and vomit) in New York 😂#Wimbledon pic.twitter.com/Wi6TjivlE2\n\n'That's the closest I had been and it was obviously difficult.

Those doubts started trickling in a lot into my game. I don’t know why those thoughts were so prevalent,” Osaka, who has publicly detailed her struggles with mental health, told reporters. “I didn’t feel like I was playing that well. I guess, like, those doubts started trickling in a lot into my game. Obviously the second set wasn’t that great. \n\n“I feel like for me, I don’t know… I don’t know why those thoughts were so prevalent, yeah.”\n\nThe Japanese star, back on the tour after a 15-month maternity break, has not been able to get past the second round in consecutive tournaments, though she did give World No. 1 Iga Swiatek a scare on the clay courts at the French Open last month.\n\nWhatever confidence she may have gained by beating Diane Parry in the first round of Wimbledon came undone against Navarro, the tournament’s 19th seed, as Osaka was broken in the seventh game of the first set after four errors.\n\n“I do know that my last clay court match was really good,” she said, smiling. “So I might end up liking that surface a lot more than grass now.”\n\nNew York native Navarro, however, dominated her way to victory and a third-round matchup that has yet to be determined. \n\n“Naomi’s obviously a great player, it’s great to have her back,’ Navarro said on court. “I obviously wanted to get the win today, (and) played some really good tennis at times. It’s my first time on Centre Court. It doesn’t really seem to be real.”\n\nFor Osaka, who entered the tournament ranked 113th, its the end of the road at Wimbledon — for this year, at least. \n\n“I’m a little disappointed because I wanted to do really well,” she said. “I feel like I put a lot of time into it. There’s always next year, so…”\n\nThe 26-year-old will turn her focus to daughter Shai, who turns 1 this week, and the upcoming Paris Olympics, where she will compete for Japan.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement"

Gone are the days of relentless matches every two days; teams will now have a more manageable schedule of three pool matches within three groups of four. \n\nThis shift from group five matches to three not only ensures players arrive at the quarterfinals with greater stamina; it also creates a more balanced competition with 12 teams divided equally in the opening stage. \n\nThe top two teams from each pool, along with the two best third-place finishers, will earn quarterfinal spots. From there, it's a single-elimination tournament until an Olympic champion is crowned.\n\nThe United States women's national volleyball team soared to its first ever gold medal at the Tokyo Olympics, beating Brazil in the championship match.\n\nThe men's volleyball competition in Tokyo saw France emerge victorious, snatching the gold medal from the feared Russian team, while Argentina beat volleyball powerhouse Brazil for bronze.\n\nAhead of the 2024 Olympics, the Soviet Union still leads the rankings in Olympic volleyball, having won a total of 12 medals from 1964 to 1988. Brazil and the U.S. are tied for second, having won 11 medals each.\n\nItaly is the highest-ranked women's national volleyball team worldwide in the International Volleyball Federation's world rankings. The U.S. sits at fifth in the women's rankings heading into the 2024 Olympics.\n\nPoland is No. 1 in the men's rankings entering Paris. The team claimed the Volleyball Nations League (VNL) 2023 title and the European Championship. The U.S. men rank sixth ahead of the Paris Games.\n\n"

And as winners spun and sped off her racket, and the women’s draw opened up further after her 6-1, 6-2 slam dunk of Elise Mertens, a question began to form. Just how far into this fortnight might she go?\n\nThe 21-year-old is ranked only 135 in the world after the surgery to her wrists and an ankle, but the bookies are already taking cover. In fact they make her a favourite to make the semi-finals. Fanciful? Not after this.\n\nMertens is no mug. She has been ranked as high as 12 in the world and was expected to give a stern test of the Briton’s credentials. Yet long before the end the Belgian was staring wistfully at her box, seeking solutions that never came.\n\nThe last time Raducanu played on Court One, as an 18-year-old in her first grand slam in 2021, she suffered nerves and a shortness of breath, which forced her to retire in her fourth-round match against Ajla Tomljanovic. This time it was only the crowd that was left breathless.\n\n“I’m super-pleased with that performance,” Raducanu said. “I just had so much fun on the court. I felt the atmosphere was amazing with the crowd – I really fed off of it and played some really good stuff.”\n\nHer only false notes came at the start, as first she sent a forehand long and then double-faulted in the opening two points of the match. But after rattling off the next four points to hold serve she then got motoring.\n\nWithin 21 minutes, Mertens was 4-0 down and watching as Raducanu jumped into forehands and sprayed winners from all over the court. While the 28-year-old finally got on the ­scoreboard, the first set was quickly gone – and soon afterwards the match.\n\nWhen Raducanu was asked whether this was the best tennis she had played for years, the crowd answered for her with loud shouts of “yes”. It was hard to argue.\n\n“I knew all the hard yards would lead to something and I am just happy I can reap some of the rewards here in Wimbledon,” she said.\n\nThose rewards could also come in the mixed doubles, where she will form an exciting partnership with Andy Murray. “I got asked, and in literally 10 seconds I was like: ‘Yeah.’\n\n“For me, it’s a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity. It’s been a dream of mine since I was a young girl watching the Olympics.\n\n“At the end of my life, I know I’m going to have that memory of playing Wimbledon with Andy Murray on a home slam. It was an honour to be asked. Hopefully I can learn a thing or two about coming to the net.”\n\nShe is also determined that their makeshift pairing won’t be there to make up the numbers. “I really don’t want to let him down,” she said. “I’m going to be on my best form, ­­trying hard. And I’ll probably be more ­nervous for that than the singles.”\n\nBut for the next few days Raducanu’s focus will be on the singles’ draw. In the third round she will play the ninth seed, Greece’s Maria Sakkari, whom she beat in straight sets in their US Open semi-final in 2021 on the way to winning the first and so far only title of her career.\n\nThat is not the only echo of three years ago, either. Back then she benefited from a draw that opened up when a number of seeds crashed out early. And the signs are that is happening again.\n\nThe pre-tournament favourite, Aryna Sabalenka, who was in her quarter, pulled out with injury. As did the 22nd seed, Ekaterina ­Alexandrova, who Raducanu should have played in the first round.\n\nWith other seeds in her quarter, including Zheng Qinwen and Mirra Andreeva, beaten, Raducanu knows she has an opportunity – even though she expects Sakkari to be a step up again. “I’m expecting a really tough match,” she said. “She’s top 10 in the world, so it’s going to be a really difficult one.”\n\nWhen asked about whether there could be parallels between Wimbledon 2024 and New York in 2021, she was just as cautious. “It’s very easy to get caught up in parallels, and things that have happened in the past,” she said. “But no situation is the same. Dynamics are always changing.”\n\nIn fact Raducanu insisted that she is so focused that she didn’t even know that the general election is on Thursday. “I think I’ll have a lie-in, then I’ll come to practice. I didn’t even know it was tomorrow, to be honest.”\n\nHowever the verdict of No 1 Court is already in as Raducanu left the court to a standing ovation. She will hope it proves infectious."

Salah and Endo will now skip the contest 'following talks', meaning they'll be completely available for pre-season and the Premier League kick-off.\r\n\n➡️ READ MORE \n\nNewcastle United are now reported to be CONFIDENT that they can keep Anthony Gordon at the club through this summer's transfer window.  \n\nThat’s according to a new report in Football Insider, which claims the Magpies have eased their financial concerns by selling two players before the June 30 profit and sustainability rules deadline.\r\n\nYankuba Minteh, a favourite of Arne Slot while on loan at Feyenoord last season, moved to Brighton at the weekend while homegrown prospect Elliott Anderson went to Nottingham Forest.\r\n\n➡️ READ MORE \n\nLiverpool have been named among the Premier League teams tracking Sunderland’s teenage sensation Chris Rigg.  \n\nThe 17-year-old midfield made a decisive breakthrough to the Sunderland first team last season, appearing in each of the Black Cats’ last 13 Championship games of the season.\r\n\nHe captained England at the recent UEFA European Under-17 Championships, where the Three Lions were beaten on penalties by eventual champions Italy at the quarter-final stage.\r\n\n➡️ READ MORE \n\nNo comments yet…\n\nYou must be logged in to post a comment.\n\nThe new LFC x Air Max range 🔥\n\nLFC x Nike Air Max\n\nLFC Retro Shirts\n\nLFC Kits\n\nLFC Nike Training\n\nAnfield Watch is a long-running Liverpool FC fan site bringing you all the  latest news from Anfield as well as transfer rumours, features, score updates, videos and interviews.

This is a huge accomplishment for everybody on Team USA and everybody on Team WNBA. They all deserve the same praise. \n\n“I don’t want it to take away from any of that and just be the focal point of All-Star weekend because that’s not fair to them. And obviously this is something that’s really hard to accomplish. The best we can celebrate all of them will be great and I’m just obviously going to soak in the experience because you never know if you’re ever going to be able to get back there. It’ll be fun for all of us, for sure.” \n\nFans are highly anticipating Clark and Reese playing on the same team after their on-court rivalry in college transitioned to the WNBA. \n\nReese led the LSU Tigers to their first championship in program history in a win over Clark and Iowa in 2023.\n\nReese famously waved her hand in front of Clark’s face — the “you can’t see me” gesture — at the end of the game, which helped fuel the rivalry. \n\nIowa defeated LSU in the Elite Eight of this year’s women’s NCAA Tournament. \n\nClark and Reese have maintained their relationship is a competitive one on the court and that nothing is personal.\n\nBoth stars helped break attendance records, viewership and ticket sales at the college level, as well as in the WNBA. \n\nThe 22-year-old Reese shed tears while reacting to her first All-Star nod as a rookie. \n\n“I’m just so happy. I know the work I’ve put in,” Reese said after he recorded her 11th straight double-double — with 12 points and 19 rebounds — in an 85-77 win against the Dream on Tuesday. “Coming into this league so many people doubted me and didn’t think my game would translate — and I wouldn’t be the player I was in college, or better, or would be worse, or wouldn’t be where I am right now.\n\n“But I trusted the process and I believed. I’m thankful that I dropped to seven and was able to come to Chicago and it’s just a blessing. I can’t thank my teammates and my coaches enough for just believing in me and trusting me. I know all of them are going to come to Phoenix and support me.” \n\nClark and Reese have been dominating on and off the court. \n\nThe Fever guard’s first Wilson signature basketballs have been unveiled. All three basketballs in the Limitless Series come in various sizes and will be available for purchase Tuesday, July 9 exclusively at Wilson.com and at select Wilson retail locations.\n\nThe WNBA All-Star game will tip off July 20 at 8:30 p.m. in Phoenix and air on ABC.\n\nESPN will air a skills challenge and a 3-point contest on July 19 at 6 p.m.\n\nThis year’s festivities will also feature the third annual WNBA Live — the league’s two-day fan festival, which will celebrate the intersection of the WNBA, fashion, music and culture — that will take place at the Phoenix Convention Center July 19-20.\n\nAdvertisement"

Rain had fallen across several spells, ensuring that the Centre Court roof was closed throughout all three of its matches, but outside courts such as where Evans was playing didn't have that luxury.\n\n\"I've already been hurt on a wet court this season, I'm not willing to do it again,\" Evans said to the Court 12 umpire between points as he sat down, reluctant to continue playing.\n\nHe similarly fumed at the court supervisor, who he bluntly told: \"You don't care about the players.\"\n\nEvans drew level with Tabilo at 3-3 before play was suspended on the court amid Evans' concerns of re-injuring his knee on the slippery surface.\n\nHaving started at 7.45pm, Evans' clash was among several to be suspended including Felix Auger-Aliassime vs Thanasi Kokkinakis, David Goffin vs Tomas Machac and Lucas Pouille vs Laslo Djere.\n\n\n\nOur community members are treated to special offers, promotions, and adverts from us and our partners.

He had a scare at Queen's Club when suffering a nasty fall, only for scans to reveal a strain rather than lasting damage.\n\nEvans is due to play at the Olympics after Wimbledon, where he has entered with Andy Murray, though his partner's participation is in doubt after pulling out of the summer Slam's singles competition.\n\nWe use your sign-up to provide content in ways you've consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

        "expanded content": "SAN FRANCISCO – Brandin Podziemski showed as much promise and production by a Warriors rookie in quite some time throughout the 2023-24 NBA season. The 21-year-old guard became the first Warrior to be named to the All-Rookie First Team since Eric Paschall in 2019-20, and only the fourth to do so since Steph Curry earned the honor as a rookie 14 years ago. \n\nThe Warriors’ blowout loss to the Sacramento Kings in the NBA Play-In Tournament left a bitter taste for Podziemski that only added hunger for someone whose many goals boil down to one thing throughout this offseason: Taking his game to the next level. \n\nPodziemski’s introduction to the NBA game was a mixed bag of results at summer league a year ago. The impact he quickly would make on the pro game wasn’t immediately evident at the California Classic or in Las Vegas. His shot that saw him sink 43.8 percent of his 3-pointers at Santa Clara didn’t immediately catch fire. \n\nWith our All Access Daily newsletter, stay in the game with the latest updates on your beloved Bay Area and California sports teams!\n\nNow a year later, Podziemski knows the mindset of trying to show Steve Kerr and the front office he can fit the Warriors’ system might have gone a level too far. Following such a successful rookie season he’s looking at his second straight summer league differently. \n\n“I think this year it’s just more of how I can maximize my touches and be as efficient as I can and make the guys around me better,” Podziemski said Monday at Chase Center. \n\nAs a rookie, Podziemski led the NBA in charges (38), as well as being the Warriors’ leader in total rebounds (427) and plus/minus (plus-264). He was second to only Chris Paul in steals, fourth in total assists behind Paul, Steph Curry and Draymond Green, and fourth in 3-pointers – trailing the last season of the Curry-Klay Thompson backcourt, and Andrew Wiggins’ 91 threes were one more than Podziemski’s 90. \n\nTaking his game to the next level starts at the ground floor, beginning with an elementary skill on the surface for beginners picking up a ball. \n\nFind the latest Golden State Warriors news, highlights, analysis and more with NBC Sports Bay Area and California.\n\n“Scoring the ball more,” Podziemski said without hesitation. \n\n“You guys know about my rebounding, my playing hard – passing the ball is just something that comes naturally to me,” he added. “So focusing on scoring the ball, shooting more. This was a big emphasis from Steve to get as many threes up as we can.” \n\nPoint-of-attack defense also has been a focus. \n\nNo single player is going to erase Klay Thompson and replace the franchise icon who has moved on to the Dallas Mavericks in free agency. Podziemski also might be first in line. \n\nKerr’s first replacement for Thompson in the Warriors’ starting lineup wasn’t an established veteran but a rookie who had 46 NBA games to his name and 13 starts. From that point on, including Thompson’s first game off the bench, Podziemski averaged 8.2 points, 5.8 rebounds and 3.5 assists per game on 43.3-percent shooting and 38.8 percent as a 3-point shooter. He took an average of three shots beyond the arc in that span. \n\nCurry averaged 11.8 3-point attempts per game last season, and Thompson put up nine per game. \n\nNearly half of Podziemski’s points as a rookie came within 10 feet of the basket. In every aspect of the game he plays bigger than his size, and Podziemski displayed a combination of craftiness with his floaters and an ability to try and attack the rim. The Warriors now, entering Podziemski’s second pro season, need his offensive game to closer resemble what made him the West Coast Conference Player of the Year at Santa Clara when he was shooting nearly six 3-pointers per game. \n\n“Who can kind of get in that slot of shooting seven to 10 a game?” Podziemski pondered. “Because three is worth more than two but it also opens the floor for [Jonathan Kuminga] and [Andrew Wiggins] and it just helps them out a bunch too.” \n\nSince May 1, two weeks after the Warriors’ season ended, Podziemski has been working out at Chase Center. Back home during his few visits to the Milwaukee area of Wisconsin, he trained two-a-days with Travis Diener, who spent five seasons in the NBA. Whatever court Podziemski has been on he has been drilled through every possible shooting scenario from deep, whether it is running off screens, ball screens, off the dribble, dribble handoffs or catch-and-shoot. \n\nThink of a footwork action and Podziemski has attempted it these past two months. \n\n“I think for him it’s just showing the work that he’s been putting in,” Warriors summer league head coach Anthony Vereen said. “He’s an amazing shooter. We have confidence in him, and he has confidence to shoot. I hope you all see that as this summer league goes on.” \n\nChase Center will continue to be Podziemski’s main place of work for the next few days as a member of the Warriors’ summer league team. In mid-June, Kerr approached Podziemski with the opportunity to be part of the 2024 USA Basketball Men’s Select Team. It was announced on June 28 that Podziemski and Warriors teammate Trayce Jackson-Davis made the 15-man roster that will practice against Kerr and Team USA from June 6 through 9. \n\nCurry, Kerr and Team USA play Team Canada on June 10 in an exhibition game. Podziemski, Jackson-Davis and the Warriors’ summer league team will be at Chase Center playing the Kings in the California Classic. Both are expected to play all four games in Las Vegas. \n\nHe might be his newest starting backcourt mate, but Podziemski is most looking forward to battling Curry in Team USA practices, along with Jrue Holiday, Anthony Edwards and Tyrese Haliburton. \n\n“Any guards that they’ve got,” Podziemski said. “I think those are the primary four I’m excited to go against. But really just to see [Kevin Durant], [LeBron James] and all those guys – how they go about their day.” \n\nThe ever-confident lefty will compete against a group that already is being compared to the Dream Team or better. His competitiveness is what shined brightest in his debut NBA season. He also is the rookie who came out and watched Curry for the entirety of his famous pregame workouts to be a spectator, observer and learner. \n\nCoaches and teammates laugh about his brashness, but he’s known in high regard by them for being an eager sponge. \n\n“I think this is a stepping stone,” Podziemski said of the USA Select Team. “Some guys that played on the 2020 Select Team like Anthony Edwards, Tyrese Haliburton are now on the Olympic team in 2024. Seeing that is something that I want to repeat so I can play on the ‘28 Olympic team.” \n\nEverything from his impressive and encouraging rookie campaign is in the past. Podziemski will have the ball in his hands and be the main option in summer league. He will be around the game's giants to prepare them for the Paris Summer Olympics. \n\nThe Warriors are creating a completely new show, and Podziemski, barring a trade, has an avenue to be cast as a main character. All that matters, as he made clear, is reaching the next level.\n\nDownload and follow the Dubs Talk Podcast"

(Getty Images: Daniela Porcelli)\n\nThere are concerns proposed changes to federal laws could see people who stream sport locked out from watching major events like the AFL and NRL grand finals\n\nStreaming is growing in popularity, with about 1 million people watching the Matildas WC semifinal against England via the internet\n\nThe matter returns to the Senate on Wednesday.\n\nThe 1 million people who watched the Matildas' World Cup semifinal against England last year via streaming would have been blocked from seeing it under proposed changes to federal laws.\n\nThat is according to the Greens, who said the changes to the anti-siphoning scheme could see events like the NRL and AFL grand finals behind a paywall for those who do not watch TV via their aerial.\n\nThe proposed reforms introduced by the Albanese government are currently before the Senate.\n\nSpeaking about the difficulty of finding Australian networks on smart TVs, Network Ten's chief content officer said despite being tech savvy, it took her almost an hour with an engineer's help to get her own company's app downloaded on her television.\n\nThe federal government's mechanism to ensure Australians can watch events like the Olympics and the Boxing Day Test for free is the anti-siphoning scheme.\n\nUniversity of Western Sydney Emeritus Professor of Cultural Research David Rowe said it was a policy that had generally been successful.\n\n\"They were established in the 1990s when pay television came in, essentially to prevent what are called events of national importance and cultural significance being captured exclusively by pay TV,\" Dr Rowe said.\n\n\"These events are listed by the minister for communications, it's called the anti-siphoning list — events on that list that include the Olympics, the grand finals, Australian representative teams — they have to be offered first to free-to-air television, so it can't be offered to a subscription platform.\"\n\n\"It is really a strong way of discouraging this migration of key sports onto pay platforms or subscription services.\"\n\nBut the way we watch sport is changing.\n\nThe federal government's reforms to the anti-siphoning scheme were introduced late last year to update it to cover streaming.\n\nHowever, Greens senator Sarah Hanson-Young said they left a loophole.\n\n\"The government's legislation is protecting some key sporting moments for access on free-to-air television on your old-school TV with your aerial, but its not protecting it and guaranteeing it will be free on digital services,\" she said.\n\nHer fear is that could see sport streaming rights bought up by someone like Foxtel or Netflix, who could put it behind a paywall.\n\n\"So what we'll have is a large number of Australians who don't watch television with an aerial, they won't be able to access their favourite football team or the Matildas or the Boxing Day Test match for free,\" Senator Hanson-Young said.\n\nUnder that circumstance, people with an aerial could still watch sport for free, but those who watch sport on apps like ABC iview, 7Plus or 9Now would be blocked if they were streaming it on a smart TV, tablet or phone.\n\nCommunications Minister Michelle Rowland says streaming rights to major upcoming sporting competitions have already been clinched by commercial giants. (ABC News: Ian Cutmore)\n\nThe number of people that would be affected is hard to put an exact figure on but streaming is growing in popularity.\n\nBridgette Fair is the CEO of Free TV, the peak body for Australia's commercial free-to-air broadcasters.\n\nShe said last year's 2023 Women's World Cup semifinal was an indicator of how many people stream sport.\n\n\"Last year, we saw the Matildas play England. More than 7 million Australians on average watched that game and over a million of those people were watching through the internet,\" she said.\n\n\"We know that over the past three years there's been an almost 500 per cent growth in sports audiences watching using the internet versus over the aerial.\n\n\"Last year's AFL Grand Final — the number of people watching over the internet quadrupled over the previous year and similar figures for the NRL Grand Final.\"\n\nCommunications Minister Michelle Rowland said the vast majority of Australians still had access to free-to-air television.\n\n\"The Department's Television and Media Survey 2023 shows that watching through a broadcast signal and antenna was the top response for how Australians most often access free-to-air television,\" she said.\n\nMs Rowland also said the streaming rights to some major sporting competitions had already been locked up for the coming years.\n\n\"The Nine Network has the rights, including streaming rights, to the NRL premiership until 2027, the Australian Open until 2029, and the Olympics until 2032,\" she said.\n\n\"The Seven Network has the rights, including streaming rights, to matches of the AFL premiership until 2031, and international cricket matches played in Australia through to 2031.\"\n\nSenator Hanson-Young said her concern was if a loophole existed, it would eventually be taken advantage of, so the Greens introduced their own amendment to the anti-siphoning scheme reforms.\n\n\"I'll be pushing through an amendment to fix this, to close the loophole so that all Australians can access sport for free on whatever device they watch,\" she said.\n\n\"That means ensuring that those free-to-air television stations like channel 7, 9, 10, ABC or SBS — if you get the sporting rights for terrestrial television, you can carry over that licence to your digital service.\"\n\nThe matter returns to the Senate on Wednesday.\n\nTopic:NRL\n\nTopic:Paralympic Games\n\nTopic:Sport\n\nTopic:Police\n\nTopic:State of Origin\n\nTopic:Health\n\nAnalysis by Patricia Karvelas\n\nTopic:Foreign Aid\n\nTopic:Alternative Energy\n\nTopic:Courts\n\nTopic:Federal Government\n\nAustralia\n\nFederal Government\n\nInformation and Communication\n\nSport\n\nTelevision\n\nTopic:Health\n\nAnalysis by Patricia Karvelas\n\nTopic:Foreign Aid\n\nTopic:Alternative Energy\n\nTopic:Courts\n\nTopic:World War 2\n\nTopic:Children's Health\n\nTopic:Activism and Lobbying\n\nTopic:Indigenous Culture\n\nWe acknowledge Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples as the First Australians and Traditional Custodians of the lands where we live, learn, and work.\n\nThis service may include material from Agence France-Presse (AFP), APTN, Reuters, AAP, CNN and the BBC World Service which is copyright and cannot be reproduced.\n\nAEST = Australian Eastern Standard Time which is 10 hours ahead of GMT (Greenwich Mean Time)"

The top four have come this season alone, all for games involving Caitlin Clark and the Fever.\n\nIndiana’s win was the most-watched WNBA game to ever involve Phoenix great Diana Taurasi. Her previous most-watched WNBA game was her career debut against Connecticut in May 2004 (1.43M). (Taurasi has played in front of larger audiences since, but only during the Olympics.)\n\nFever-Mercury was the tenth WNBA game this season to average at least one million viewers. The league entered this season having gone nearly 16 years without a single seven-figure audience. The ten games with one million viewers is the most in a single WNBA season since the league’s final year with NBC in 2002 (12).\n\nAs one would expect, nine of the ten games to top the million viewer mark have involved Clark and the Fever. The exception was Sparks-Aces on May 18, which had a direct lead-in from the Fever against New York. (One other non-Clark game finished just shy of the million viewer mark, Liberty-Aces earlier this month at 996,000.)\n\n\n\nIt bears noting that despite all of the viewership marks set by Clark and the Fever this season, none of the games have yet to rank among the ten most-watched WNBA games all-time, a list that still consists exclusively of games on NBC from 1997-2002.\n\nFever-Mercury was the second half of a WNBA doubleheader that opened with Dream-Liberty at 586,000.\n\n\n\t\t\t\tJon Lewis has been covering the sports media industry on a daily basis since 2006 as the founder and main writer of Sports Media Watch. You can contact him here or on the social media websites X (Twitter) or Bluesky.\t\t\t\n\nCaitlin Clark is headed to the injury list.\n\nA look at the significance of NASCAR's first race on Prime Video.\n\nCaitlin Clark's second season may be an even bigger draw than the first.\n\nWelcome back to \"The Needle,\" a new ratings-focused column on Sports Media Watch that will break down the numbers,...\n\nTo be honest with you, these ratings so far are disappointing. Call me crazy but I really thought by now the league as a whole would see ratings in the 1 million range and that at least one game with Clark would reach at least 3 million. It looks like this is where things are settling in to (1-2 million for Clark, 500,000-900,000 for other games). If that’s as good as it gets with the most popular player in league history and perhaps the most popular athlete right now, that’s not a great sign. It’s good enough compared to things like NHL and UFL and but it’s not meeting the national hype. It’s almost like the NBA situation. There’s no way that league deserves a $76 billion deal but the hype machine by networks like ESPN and even FS1 would make you think it’s way ahead of baseball which it isn’t. Basketball (both NBA and WNBA) have become so overrated in it’s supposed popularity compared to reality. Like 4th&long keeps saying, it’s Clark or bust right now.\n\nYou are really misusing the word “historic” here. The fourth-highest WNBA audience since 2001? Yeah, they’ll really be writing about this one in history books in the decades and centuries to come. It’s not history. It’s not television history. It’s not even sports-television history. It’s a footnote to a contemporary sports-television news item.\n\nInteresting that NBC aired the 10 most viewed WNBA games, which I believe were in the Jordan Era. Do you expect NBC to air selected WNBA games, maybe in a doubleheader with the NBA, in the yet to announced new contract?\n\nYes, all indications are that NBC will air WNBA games in the new deal.\n\nJust read a related article in the NY Times/ Athletic. They give credit to Sports Media Watch. Also, they said the WNBA is up 183% on ESPN vs last year and the pregame show is up 111% vs last year (503K average). Adding in the numbers for the WNBA, it looks like the NBA is the only professional entity that has an inventory of 1M viewership games that spans a calendar year minus 1 month from September 19 (end of WNBA playoffs) to October 22 (NBA season start).\n\nYes — NBA may not be hitting the high notes it used to, but the floor is higher than anything else outside of football.\n\nThe games sans Clark are doing about 35% of what Clark games are doing.  Are these really WNBA rating or GWC ratings?  The are highly dependent on Clark.  She’s a phenom.   The WNBA – not so much.\n\nWow, that’s news.  How does that impact the ION and other existing WNBA TV contracts?\n\nPer John Ourand, the WNBA is likely to end up with the same partners as the NBA, with the league getting to sell an additional package outside of the NBA deal. That would likely go to ION.\n\n\nAbout  •  Contact •  Report an Error • Privacy \n\n© 2025 Jon Lewis, Sports Media Watch\n\n© 2025 Sports Media Watch"

        "expanded content": "England football superstar Jude Bellingham is at the centre of a firestorm at the Euros in Germany after performing an allegedly X-rated gesture following the thrilling 2-1 win over Slovakia.\n\nUefa are officially investigating the incident in which Bellingham appeared to feign grabbing his crotch towards the opposition bench.\n\nBut he’s emphatically denied any suggestion that it was an insult, or aimed at Slovakia’s team or officials, stating on X (formerly Twitter): ‘It was an inside joke gesture towards some close friends who were at the game. Nothing but respect for how that Slovakia team played tonight.’\n\nWatch Piers' explosive interviews on his Uncensored YouTube channel here\n\nHowever, if the authorities don’t believe him then Bellingham could be banned from Saturday’s crucial quarter-final clash with Switzerland, and possibly more games too if we progress further in the tournament.\n\nSo, the stakes couldn’t be higher; in fact, England’s chances of winning the Euros could well come down to persuading Uefa that our star man was indeed gesticulating to his mates, and to providing a strong enough explanation of the message he was passing on to have him exonerated.\n\nAs my own gesture of support, as part of the ‘Justice for Jude’ campaign, I have compiled a list of ten things he might have been trying to communicate:\n\nThe best, and most easily provable, excuse is that he was just telling his mates he’s got massive cojones. \n\nJude, a young man with a very healthy ego, used this very signal before when he’s scored huge late goals. \n\nIndeed, he did it in April when he netted a last-minute winner for Real Madrid against Barcelona in another El Clasico. \n\nAnd that time, it was towards his own fans so couldn’t possibly be an insult. \n\nFrankly, if a 21-year-old footballer can’t boast about having big balls when he scores wonder-goals, then what the hell is the world coming to?\n\nIt was a cry for medical help. \n\nJude was informing his mates that he twinged his groin performing the heroic overhead kick that saved England from an early Euros exit, abject ignominy and global mockery. \n\nIf you study the incredibly skilful manoeuvre he made, it’s very clear that in bending his body into the right place to execute the shot, his lower abdominal area came under severe pressure, and he wanted his mates to tell England’s physio he’d need an urgent massage when he came off the pitch.\n\nHe’s an incredible romantic who was flashing a 5-digit signal (four fingers and a thumb) to his mates to go buy him a bottle of Chanel No5 perfume as a celebratory gift for his girlfriend, Dutch model Laura Celia Valk. \n\nHe has to keep her happy because their relationship is now being talked up as potentially bigger than Posh and Becks, and right up there with Taylor Swift and Travis Kelce. \n\nThis would also explain the fingers-to-nose gesture which was obviously him telling them to keep it quiet and not let her get a whiff of his present before he gave it to her.\n\nHe was making an urgent cupping gesture to denote that he and Harry Kane both wanted cups of tea after the game. \n\nJude barely drinks alcohol, and Harry is teetotal. \n\nThe fact he deliberately moved his fingers to his parched lips after the cupping signal is further evidence that it was all very clearly a request for his mates to make them much-needed, medically recommended, soothingly hydrating CUPS OF TEA.\n\nJude was making a joke about all the rave reviews he’s had in the past year declaring that he is ‘the complete package.’ \n\nThese reviews have inevitably led to his mates constantly ribbing him about his ‘complete package’ in the way that all men do with their male friends whenever there’s any reference to a package of any kind. \n\nJude’s repeated gesticulation towards a certain part of his anatomy was a deadpan statement of confirmation that his package is indeed impressively complete.\n\nJude’s shirt number for Real Madrid is No5, so he was sending a subliminal message to his mates (who we can pretend are all Real Madrid fans for the purposes of this investigation) that the genius level of his goal was entirely down to the elite-level training he’s done at Madrid that’s made him one of the world’s best players.\n\nHe was channelling one of his heroes, Cristiano Ronaldo, who once celebrated an El Clasico goal for Madrid against Barcelona in the rival’s Nou Camp stadium by sticking his hands out and saying ‘calma, calma’, then shushing them with his fingers. \n\nJude just forgot which way he should be pointing his hands, and that you shush by putting your fingers to your lips not your nose – both easy mistakes to make in the pressure cauldron of an international tournament when you’ve just helped win a crucial knock-out match with a worldie.\n\nJude was highlighting the iconic 5 Olympic rings because he wants to raise awareness that it’s ridiculous Team GB won’t be fielding a men’s football team in the upcoming Paris Olympics.\n\nThis is due to the stupid ongoing dispute between the four home nation teams that means they can’t agree to play together. \n\nJude’s livid that this will stop him winning an Olympic medal and was merely letting off steam about it.\n\n\n\nJude was starving hungry after the match, not least because he expended so much more energy during the 30 minutes of extra time, so he was frantically telling his mates that his stomach needed filling with his favourite dish, baked beans and eggs.\n\nJude was winding up Gary Lineker, who branded the England team as ‘sh*t’ after an earlier match, by pointing out he’s better endowed than the BBC’s star presenter, which is almost certainly true.\n\n©News Group Newspapers Limited in England No. 679215 Registered office: 1 London Bridge Street, London, SE1 9GF. \"The Sun\", \"Sun\", \"Sun Online\" are registered trademarks or trade names of News Group Newspapers Limited.

        "expanded content": "\nAndscape\n\n\nThree weeks before the Paris Games, here’s who stood out in Eugene, Oregon, for the Americans\n\nThe U.S. Olympic Team Trials in track and field wrapped up Sunday, and Team USA seems primed to have a productive showing at the 2024 Paris Olympics starting July 26.\n\nWith 48 combined men’s and women’s medal events, there are countless storylines that have come out of   trials held in June. Defending Olympic 800-meter gold medalist Athing Mu fell during the trials, costing her a chance to defend her title. Three-time Olympian Lolo Jones attempted a comeback at age 41 and advanced to the semifinals of the 100-meter hurdles. After breaking her foot during the 2021 Olympic trials cost her a spot in Tokyo, heptathlete Anna Hall finally earned her spot at the Games after winning gold at this year’s trials.\n\nBut with less than a month until the track and field events commence, Andscape looks at the top 5 American storylines coming out of the trials. \n\nPatrick Smith/Getty Images\n\n5. The high school phenom. The only headline you need to read about Quincy Wilson is this: youngest American male track athlete to appear at an Olympics. After capturing the world’s attention June 24 at the trials, the 16-year-old high school student is headed to Paris as a member of the men’s 4×400 relay pool. Wilson, who doesn’t have his driver’s license yet and has plans to start his own Twitch account, burst onto the scene after breaking the under-18 world record in the 400 meters at last week’s trials — twice. That record (44.69 seconds set by Darell Robinson in 1982) had stood for 42 years before Wilson ran 44.66 seconds in the first round at the trials and 44.59 seconds in the semifinals. Wilson’s 44.94 finish in the finals placed him in sixth and out of the 400 meters for Paris, but it was his third time finishing under 45 seconds over three days and led to his inclusion in the relay pool.\n\nChristian Petersen/Getty Images\n\n4. Can anyone catch Gabby Thomas? Thomas, the bronze medalist in the 200 meters at the Tokyo Games in 2021 and the 2023 world championships silver medalist, is already a favorite to take gold in the 200 in Paris, as she owns the two fastest times in the event this season, both of which came during the Olympic trials. If Thomas were to finish in first in Paris next month, she’d be the first American woman since 2012 (Allyson Felix) to win gold in the women’s 200. That path has become easier because two-time defending Olympic champion Elaine Thompson-Herah of Jamaica will miss this year’s Games due to injury. Never mind, though: Thomas casually held her wrist and smiled after running a world-leading 21.78 seconds in the women’s semifinal June 28, showing that it might just be that easy for her at the Olympics. That is, unless Ole Miss redshirt senior McKenzie Long, who owns the third-fastest 200 meters time this season (21.83 seconds) when she won the NCAA championship in the event, has something to say about that.\n\nChristian Petersen/Getty Images\n\n3. The best to do it. The only reason Sydney McLaughlin-Levrone isn’t a bigger American track star is because her event, the 400-meter hurdles, isn’t as sexy of a race as the short sprints or relays. Know this though: McLaughlin-Levrone is the best there is, best there was, and best there ever will be in the hurdles. She set a world record in the hurdles back in 2021 — 51.46 seconds — and went on to set records four times over the last three years. It’s not so much if McLaughlin-Levrone wins gold in Paris next month, but rather what will be her time when she wins. No woman has broken the 50-second mark in the 400 hurdles, but with the way McLaughlin-Levrone has constantly reset the bar over the last few years, it may just happen. To further drive home just how good McLaughlin-Levrone is: She has the fastest time in 400 meters and sixth-fastest time in the 200 meters this season.\n\nPatrick Smith/Getty Images\n\n2. Can Noah Lyles make history? Possibly the least noteworthy thing about Lyles is him being the best sprinter in the world right now. His — no pun intended — track record speaks for itself. World leader in the 200 meters this season. Three-time reigning world champion in the 200 meters. Top American men’s sprinter. But no, instead it’s all of Lyles’ high jinks and shenanigans that make him one of the more fascinating athletes headed into Paris. His star turn came in 2023 when, after taking gold at that year’s world championships, he criticized NBA Finals winners for calling themselves “world champions.” That started a beef with American hoopers, that when you think about it, Lyles actually had a point. Now a year later and Lyles is whipping out rare Yu-Gi-Oh! trading cards while at the starting blocks before his races and puffing his chest after cruising to victories. Aside from a possible spoiler in Kishane Thompson of Jamaica, who set the world-leading 100 meters time (9.77 seconds) at his country’s Olympic trials June 28, Lyles could become the first American man since Carl Lewis in 1984 to win the Olympic 100/200 meter double at the Olympics.\n\nChristian Petersen/Getty Images\n\n1. Sha’Carri Richardson is back. Richardson’s story is well known. After taking first place in the 100 meters at the 2021 Olympic trials, Richardson was banned from the 2021 Games after testing positive for THC. Richardson didn’t take the loss well — she lashed out at critics on Twitter and had an embarrassing last-place finish in the 100 meters at the Prefontaine Classic meet in August 2021 against Jamaican sprinters Thompson-Herah, Shelly-Ann Fraser-Pryce and Shericka Jackson. But after a two-year hiatus, Richardson returned with a come-from-behind victory over Fraser-Pryce and Jackson in the 100 meters at the 2023 World Athletic Championship in Budapest, Hungary. Richardson continued her comeback story, with a gold in the 100 meters June 24. While Richardson placed fourth in the 200 meters, failing to qualify for Paris, that was due more to circumstances than skill: She had the second-fastest time in the prelims, and sixth-fastest time of the year, at 21.92 seconds but had run five races by the time she ran in the 200 meters final. Richardson seems primed for a rematch with Jackson and Fraser-Pryce in the 100 meters in Paris, which based on performance so far — she has four of the fastest 11 times in the world this year in the 100 — makes her the favorite.\n\nMartenzie Johnson is a senior writer for Andscape.

The former boys doubles Wimbledon champion lost to Kecmanovic 2-6, 6-3, 3-6, 4-6 in 2 hours and 48 minutes at the SW19. Nagal, playing his first match in the main draw of Wimbledon, put up a brave fight before going down in the opening round. \n\nSumit Nagal, who qualified for the Paris Olympics last month, showed flashes of brilliance but paid the price for inconsistency in the opening round on his weakest surface. Nagal went down 2-6 in the opening round against his good friend Kecmanovic, but he fought back to take the second set 6-3. Nagal was hitting them cleanly and was covering the court well, sparking hopes of a come-from-behind win. However, Krecmanovic made it 2-1 and put the pressure back on the Indian star. \n\nWimbledon 2024: Full Coverage \n\nNagal was down 1-5 in the final set, but the World No. 73 did not throw in the towel. Nagal broke back, battled to stay in the match, and got to a game away from levelling. However, Krecmanovic held his nerves and got the job done in four sets. \n\nNagal spoke about the difficulty of playing on grass, which is not his favourite surface despite the Wimbledon boys' doubles win nine years ago. The Indian singles player arrived early in London to train for the opening round after having had an extended clay court swing in the season. \n\nNagal's lack of exposure to the surface was evident as the 26-year-old fluffed opportunities to seize control of the match. \n\nNagal's singles campaign is over, but he will be in action in doubles, partnering Serbia's Dusan Lajovic in Wimbledon. The Indo-Serbian duo will open its campaign against Pedro Martinez and Jaume Munar of Spain in the men's doubles first round.Published By: Akshay RameshPublished On: Jul 2, 2024Also Read |  Watch: David Beckham reacts to Emma Raducanu's take on England's Euro 2024 performance\n"

All riders start in designated gate positions with their front wheels placed against the gate. Once the starter gives the go-ahead to begin, the gate drops and the riders race through the course.\n\nIn one-run heats, results are determined by finishing order.\n\nIn three-run heats, riders are assigned points after each run based on their finishing order: one point for first place, two points for second place, and so on. \n\n\n\nAfter the third and final run, each rider's points are added together to get a combined score. Riders are then ranked by their combined scores. \n\nThe fewer points a rider has, the better their ranking.\n\nRaces are rife with contact due to the nature of the sport, and therefore crashes can and do occur. Despite the obvious impact on times, those who do happen to crash can still earn points if they're able to finish. However, it's forbidden to force another rider off the track or intentionally make contact to impede another rider's progress.\n\nThe competition begins with the quarterfinals, in which three heats of eight riders compete in a three-run series.

At the end of three runs, the eight cyclists with the lowest point totals advance to the final.\n\nIn both the quarterfinals and the semifinals, riders are reseeded for the next heat according to time.

He’s given so much to the sport and given so much to this event and he wants to be out there in front of British fans one more time.\n\n\"But when you understand what he’s been through - he had back surgery a long time ago, he had the well documented hip surgery and then only nine or ten days ago to have had surgery to remove a cyst close to his spinal cord - it just emphasises his hunger and desire to get out there.\n\n“Fingers crossed he can get out there and have one last chance to be on Centre Court.\n\n“I echo Nick’s words that I hope he doesn’t do any sort of permanent or lasting damage. It’s pretty clear to see he loves this sport.”\n\n© 2025 talkSPORT Limited\nRegistered in England No. 2806093.

Riders will take the track either alone (in the case of the qualification round) or side-by-side (in the case of head-to-head races). Each race will encompass three laps and take about two minutes.\n\nThe competition starts with all 30 riders participating in the qualification round. Riders complete three laps, but only the final 200 meters are timed. The 24 riders with the fastest times advance to the elimination rounds and are seeded according to their times.\n\nIn the first elimination round, the 24 remaining riders race in 12 head-to-head matchups (based on seeding). The winning rider in each heat advances directly to the second round, while the losers enter a repechage round. In the repechage, there are four heats of three riders and the winner of each heat moves on to the second round.\n\nIn the second elimination round, the 16 remaining riders race in eight head-to-head matchups. The winning rider in each heat advances directly to the third round, while the losers enter a repechage round. In the repechage, there are four heats of two riders and the winner of each heat moves on to the third round.\n\n\n\nIn the third elimination round, the 12 remaining riders race in six head-to-head matchups. The winning rider in each heat advances directly to the quarterfinals, while the losers enter a repechage round. In the repechage, there are two heats of three riders and the winner of each heat moves on to the quarterfinals.\n\nFrom the quarterfinals onward, there are no more repechage rounds and each matchup is decided by a best-of-three series.\n\nThe winners of the four quarterfinal heats advance to the semifinals. The winners of the two semifinal heats advance to the gold medal final, while the two losers go to the bronze medal final.\n\nThe men's and women's team sprint will each have eight teams participating and each team will consist of three riders. This will be the first time that the women's event has featured three-rider teams.\n\nEach team works together to post the fastest time over three laps (750 meters). All three riders start each race, but only the last rider finishes, and the order of cyclists does not change within the race. The lead rider sets the pace for the first 250 meters and then pulls off. After 500 meters, the second rider leaves the track while the anchor leg goes all out for the final lap.\n\nDuring head-to-head races, each team begins the race on opposite sides of the track.\n\nIn the qualification round, each team completes a time trial. Teams are then seeded according to their times.\n\nIn Round 1, the competition shifts to a head-to-head format with matchups determined by seeding. There are four matchups in Round 1, and therefore four winners. The two fastest winners in Round 1 advance to the gold medal final and the two slowest winners go to the bronze medal final.\n\nThe fields for men's and women's keirin will each have a maximum of 30 riders.\n\nEach race lasts six laps, but the first three laps are paced by a motorized bike which gradually increases its speed from 30 to 50 kilometers per hour (18.6 to 31.1 miles per hour). Once the motorized bike pulls off, the riders engage in a three-lap sprint to the finish.\n\nEach race takes about two to two-and-a-half minutes to complete.\n\nIf one or more riders pass the leading edge of the front wheel of the motorized bike before the pursuit line when it leaves the track, the race is stopped and rerun without those riders, who are disqualified.\n\nDuring the first three rounds, if ties can't be broken by a photo finish, then all tied riders will move on. If the situation happens in the final, the riders will share the same rank.\n\nIn the first round, the 30 participating athletes are grouped into five heats of six riders. The top-two finishers in each heat automatically advance to the quarterfinals, while all other riders enter a repechage round. The repechage features four heats of five riders and the top-two finishers in each heat move on to the quarterfinals.\n\nIn the quarterfinals, the 18 remaining riders are grouped into three heats of six riders. The top-four finishers in each heat advance to the semifinals.\n\nIn the semifinals, the 12 remaining riders are grouped into two heats of six riders. The top-three riders in each heat advance to the final.\n\nThe final features six riders competing in one single race. The winner of that race gets the gold medal, second place gets silver and third place gets bronze.\n\nThe men's and women's team pursuit will each have 10 teams participating and each team will consist of four riders.\n\nEach team works together to post the fastest time over 16 laps. Each team starts with four riders, and riders are allowed to change positions. The finishing time is determined by when the third rider’s front wheel crosses the finish line. If a team loses one of its riders at any point during the race, that team is still eligible to finish as long as they have three riders.\n\nDuring head-to-head heats, each team starts on opposite sides of the track. The team that crosses the finish line first (as determined by the third rider's front wheel) is the winner of the heat. Although it's less common, a team can also win a heat by catching up to the opposing team.\n\nEach race takes around four minutes to complete.\n\nIn the qualification round, each team rides the track alone and completes a time trial. The eight fastest teams move on to Round 1, but only the four fastest teams are eligible to compete for a gold medal. The other four teams can only hope for a bronze medal at best.\n\nIn Round 1, the eight remaining teams are seeded. The No. 1 seed races the No. 4 seed and the No. 2 seed races the No. 3 seed. The two winners from those heats advance to the gold medal final.\n\nMeanwhile, the No. 5 seed races the No. 8 seed and the No. 6 seed races the No. 7 seed. The teams with the two fastest times in Round 1 that did not make the gold medal final, regardless of their placement in the qualifying round, compete in the bronze medal final.\n\n\n\nThe men's and women's Madison will each have up to 15 teams participating and each team will consist of two riders.\n\nThe Madison is a two-person relay event which features a mass start. Results are determined by the number of points accumulated by each team during the event.\n\nOne rider on each team is actively competing while the other continues to ride inactive at the top of the track. Riders have unlimited exchanges and usually use what is called a \"handsling\" in which the racing cyclist pulls or tags the inactive cyclist into the race.\n\nThe men’s race is 200 laps (50 kilometers or about 31 miles) and takes about 50 minutes to complete. The women’s race is 120 laps (30 kilometers or about 18.5 miles) and takes about 35 minutes.\n\nSprints are contested every ten laps and scored as follows:\n\nOn the last sprint, double points are awarded.\n\nAny team that laps the field earns 20 points, but a team that gets lapped has 20 points deducted from its score. The team with the most accumulated points at the end of the event wins the gold medal.\n\nIn case of a tie, the finishing places for the final sprint will decide the positions. If the tie still can't be resolved, the rank will be shared.\n\nThe fields for men's and women's omnium will each have a maximum of 22 riders.\n\nThere are four races that make up the omnium and riders earn points during each of these races. At the end of the four races, the rider with the most cumulative points wins the gold medal.\n\nThe entire event is contested within a single day, but there are breaks between each race.\n\nThere are four races that make up the omnium event:\n\nThe first three races (scratch, tempo, elimination) are 40 laps for men and 30 laps for women. Riders earn 40 points for first place, 38 points for second place, 36 points for third, and so on.\n\nThe points race is 100 laps for men and 80 laps for women. Sprints are contested every ten laps and scored as follows:\n\nOn the last sprint, double points are awarded.\n\nAny rider that laps the field earns 20 points, but a rider that gets lapped has 20 points deducted from their score.\n\nIn case of a tie, the finishing places for the final sprint in the points race will decide the positions. If the tie still can't be resolved, the rank will be shared.\n\nTrack cycling events will be held from Aug. 5-11 at the National Velodrome in Montigny-le-Bretonneux, France.\n\nLearn the rules and competition formats for other cycling disciplines at the Paris Olympics."

Just going out there and doing my thing, basically doing what I do in the gym. I was just thinking it's just me and my beam or just me and the bar. I try to calm myself down beforehand. I [was thinking] I’m like the underdog, and there wasn’t so much pressure on me, which was probably a good thing.

They have been through the journey and the Olympic Games. I think they will be able to mentor me. Not just at the Games, but in terms of training. I think that will be great help for me.

So when I hit bars and beam I knew that I had a shot,” Rivera said.\n\nHer father was visibly emotional when her name was called as a member of the gymnastics team. Rivera wasn’t surprised, considering how much her family had supported her. They moved from New Jersey to Plano so that she could train at WOGA and have the best chance of making an Olympic team.\n\n“He [my dad] has been with me since the beginning and always been supporting me since I was little. It’s been so amazing having a father like him. He is my hero, my rock and always pushes me to do my best. And always comforting when things get rough,” Rivera said.\n\nThe USA Gymnastics delegation headed to the 2024 Olympic Games in Paris, France, was announced Sunday.\n\n\n\n"

Read on for details about how the men's and women's contests will work at the 2024 Olympics in Paris.\n\nThere are multiple disciplines within BMX freestyle, but the only one contested at the Olympics is BMX park. It takes place on a course that includes features such as ramps, box jumps, walls and spines.\n\nWatch NBC 4 free wherever you are\n\nThe fields for men's and women's BMX freestyle each have 12 riders. A maximum of two men and two women can compete from a single country.\n\nGet Tri-state area news delivered to your inbox with NBC New York's News Headlines newsletter.\n\nIn each round of competition, riders complete two runs through the course. Each run lasts 60 seconds.\n\nDuring their runs, riders will use obstacles on the park course to execute a variety of tricks. Each run will be scored by a panel of judge, and those results will determine the rankings.\n\n\n\nJudges score each run from 0-100 points based on \"overall impression.\" Criteria considered by the judges includes:\n\nIn the qualification round, riders will be ranked by the average score of their two runs. In the final, riders will be ranked by their best single-run score.\n\nIt's worth noting that scores are not standardized between different events. Each contest, and even each round, can end up with a different scoring \"scale\" based on a variety of factors. Essentially, each score serves as an anchor from which to compare other runs relative to it.\n\nIn the qualification round, 12 riders will be split into two separate heats. Each rider will complete two runs, and the average of their two runs will determine their overall score. The top-nine riders will advance to the final, where they will be seeded according to their overall scores.\n\nIn the final, the nine remaining riders compete in reverse order of seeding. (The top rider from the qualification round goes last for both sets of runs.) Each rider completes two runs, but only their best score is used in the final rankings. The rider with the highest single-run score wins the gold medal.\n\nBMX freestyle action will take place across two days.\n\nMen's and women's qualifying will be held on July 30 ahead of the finals for each event on July 31.\n\nLearn the rules and competition formats for other cycling disciplines at the Paris Olympics.\n\n"

The Asian Games silver medallist breached the 80m mark for the first time this season, throwing 80.84 and 80.47 in his second and third attempts at Tau Devi Lal Stadium.\n\nIt was just enough for third spot as Sahil Silwal made a personal-best throw of 81.81m. Vikant Malik took the silver medal with an 81.74m hurl.\n\nBut all eyes were on Jena, who has been going through a rough patch since his Asian Games silver when he registered a throw of 87.54m to finish behind reigning Olympic champion Neeraj Chopra. Jena had also booked a spot for the Paris Olympics through his Asiad exploits.\n\nBut in the three appearances since his triumph in Hangzhou, 78.47m had been his best throw. At the Federation Cup in Bhubaneswar, the 28-year-old managed a disappointing 75.49m to finish fifth in front of a home crowd.\n\nQuestions were raised about his fitness but Jena feels “people are justified since they have high expectations”.\n\n“I was happy to receive the criticism, in a way. I saw the true colours of certain people who spoke so highly of me earlier and then totally went against me when I hit a low. I have tried to stay away from social media but sometimes you get to hear things that disturb you. But I try to keep my head out of it,” he says.\n\nJena is not sure why he hit a slump after the Asiad despite giving his best during training sessions. Something just didn’t click for him and to make matters worse, he picked up an ankle niggle ahead of the May Fed Cup. Even though he is confident of making a full recovery before Paris, Jena feels the niggle on his block leg has forced him to not go all out yet.\n\n“The injury happened during training and I got it assessed by the Athletics Federation of India doctors who told me it’s not a cause of concern. I competed with a bandaged ankle today but it should be fine,” said Jena who will participate in the Paris Diamond League next week.\n\nEven though Sunday’s show was far below Jena’s usual standards, breaching the 80m mark took some weight off his shoulders. “I have been trying hard for a while and it does feel disappointing when the performances don’t come. Today I feel relieved that I could breach the 80m mark and that gives me the confidence I needed before Paris,” says Jena.\n\nPahal helps break relay record\n\nKiran Pahal, who just days ago rewrote the 400m national mark, ran the anchor leg for the India A team which rewrote the 4x400m mixed relay national record, clocking 3:12.87s. Mohammed Anas, Jyoti Dandi, and Muhammed Ajmal were the other team members. But even with a national record-breaking time, India will not qualify for Paris.\n\n\n\n\n\n"

So teaming up Tasva, a menswear ready-to-wear brand co-founded by Aditya Birla Fashion and Tarun Tahiliani, with the Indian Olympics Association (IOA) as the official ceremonial dress partner for Team India at the Paris Olympics 2024 feels like a natural fit.\n\nThe 2024 Summer Olympics, scheduled from July 26 to August 11, will feature over 100 Indian athletes who have qualified for the Paris Games, aiming to outperform and break the records set at 2020 Tokyo Olympics (India had sent its largest contingent with 124 athletes). At the time, for the opening ceremony, the female athletes donned beige and brown silk kurta sets with navy blue blazers, while the men wore matching navy bandhgala suits as the ceremonial outfits. In 2016, at the Rio Olympics, the internet went abuzz when our female athletes sported ombre yellow-to-blue sari with a blazer combo, while at the 2008 games in Beijing, Indian athletes wore creamy white sherwani suits during the parade.\n\nPatchwork, embroidery and fabric details\n\nThe official ceremonial outfits designed by Tasva\n\nTasva has taken a strategic approach to its designs for Team India's 2024 Olympic ceremony outfits. Just days before the official unveiling, GQ caught up with Tarun Tahiliani over Zoom to delve into this exciting collaboration, the design process, and the athlete he's particularly excited to see compete.\n\nTarun Tahiliani: This collaboration between Tasva and IOA started around five months ago, in early 2024. While initially apprehensive, I was open to the opportunity. After discussions, I began sketching ideas. My research revealed a trend of countries incorporating national flags into their designs. I championed the use of India's tricolour for this very reason. We also explored incorporating Indian fabrics like Banarasi brocade, all with a focus on creating a comfortable and contemporary look for the athletes.\n\nTarun Tahiliani: Absolutely! The design prioritises a unified look, drawing inspiration from India's tricolour. Traditional orange and green hues are woven with subtle blue accents, featuring a modern Ikat print. Hints of darker blue are in details like buttons, while patch pockets and epaulettes add that touch of sportswear and safari wear.\n\nThis time considering the unique setting of the opening ceremony on barges along the Seine, practicality was paramount. Which is why we designed gold sneakers crafted from Banarasi brocade. Breathable natural fabrics, like moss cotton and viscose crepe, have been used to combat the Parisian heat, allowing the athletes to move freely. The men's short kurtas and bundis offer a sporty yet comfortable fit, while the women's saris are pre-pleated for easy wear. We aimed for a balance between tradition and modernity.\n\nInitial sketches\n\nColours inspired by the Indian flag\n\nTarun Tahiliani: I was deeply involved in every step, from the initial sketches to the final samples. We've created one male and one female design and it's applied to all the athletes. The designs are to be modulated to their shape and size. Everyone has a different body type, depending on the sport they are participating in. If you compare the sketches, you'll notice how different the initial design iterations were. We adapted many elements based on feedback from the Olympic Committee, such as opting for saris for women instead of a more uniform look. A sari's versatility allows it to flatter any body type, and that's exactly what we want for our female athletes. For the men, a short kurta paired with a bundi offers a stylish and comfortable choice–trust me, I live in them, and I wouldn't call myself particularly athletic. The goal is to create outfits that empower our athletes to represent India with pride and confidence.\n\nThe moodboard\n\nEmbroidery details\n\nTarun Tahiliani: Designing for athletes is more about functionality and representing the country rather than glamour. The athletes had no say in the matter, unlike celebrities who have specific preferences. It was a professional endeavour focused on service and community, ensuring the outfits were practical, comfortable, and reflective of India's heritage. The spirit of the project is about unity and national pride, different from the individualised world of Bollywood fashion.\n\nTarun Tahiliani: It's hard to choose just one athlete. Of course, I would like to see India achieve as many gold medals as possible. But I hope everyone, including star athletes like Neeraj Chopra, perform well. I'm especially cheering for the spirit of India and the women athletes who have faced many challenges to get to this stage.\n\nHow to heat-proof your look with the coolest summer accessories\n\n7 bedtime fragrances that will help you get a good night’s sleep\n\n5 aquatic perfumes for men that capture the ocean in a bottle\n\nA$AP Rocky's first ever eyewear line for Ray-Ban is as iconic as the rapper\n\nThe new MM6 Maison Margiela x Salomon is for the run club's fashion guy\n\nMore From GQ India\n\nCondé Nast India\n\n© 2025 Condé Nast.

It’s not just about competing, it’s all about winning,” said Del Rosario.\n\nThrough the OQT, the Nationals hope to end the Philippines’ decades-long absence in Olympic basketball since the country last sent a team to the Summer Games in 1972.\n\nStanding in the Filipinos’ way are two formidable squads in world No. 6 Latvia and No. 23 Georgia, which both made the last 16 in the previous FIBA World Cup.\n\n“We will put them under the microscope and look for ways to win,” said Del Rosario. \n\nGilas will play two games in less than 24 hours as it tangles with Latvia at 12 am and Georgia at 8:30 pm on Thursday, July 4 (Manila time). – Rappler.com\n\nHow does this make you feel?\n\nfollow us\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

He and his older brother, Jamie, were given a wild-card invitation for doubles, too, and that event starts later in the week.\n\nThe Scot had back surgery on June 22 after needing to stop during a match a few days earlier at Queen’s Club. He said the cyst was compressing a nerve and making his right leg numb and difficult to use, and he figured before the operation it was “highly likely” he would miss Wimbledon.\n\n“It’s been a tough 10 days,” he said.\n\nMurray played a practice set Sunday.\n\n“It went pretty well, but I still don’t have 100% feeling and sensation in my leg,” he said.\n\nMurray plans to undergo medical tests on Monday — the first day of Wimbledon — and play another practice set, and then probably will make a decision in the evening.\n\nMurray owns a total of three major championships: He won the U.S. Open in 2012, and Wimbledon in 2013 and 2016. His 2013 title made him the first British man to win the singles trophy at the All England Club in 77 years.\n\nHe also is the only player with two consecutive tennis gold medals in singles at the Olympics. He won at London in 2012 — when the sport’s Summer Games matches were held at the All England Club — and at Rio de Janeiro in 2016.\n\n\n\n\nMurray underwent a pair of hip operations in 2018 and 2019. While he thought he would need to retire after the second surgery, in which he received a metal hip implant, Murray eventually returned to action.\n\nHe has since been hampered by various health issues, including tearing ligaments in his left ankle at the Miami Open in March.\n\nMurray lost in the first round of the French Open in May. \n\nHe is not the only 37-year-old with multiple Wimbledon championships on his record who is dealing with recovery from recent surgery: Novak Djokovic, who won seven of his 24 Grand Slam titles at the All England Club, had a procedure to repair a torn meniscus in his right knee less than a month ago after getting hurt at the French Open.\n\nDjokovic said Saturday he feels well enough to compete at Wimbledon — and perhaps even contend for another trophy.\n\n___\n\nAP tennis: https://apnews.com/hub/tennis\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCopyright 2025 The Associated Press.

        "expanded content": "Last Word On Basketball\n\nBasketball News, Analysis, History, Schedule, Rumors\n\nThe Los Angeles Lakers got their man.\n\nOn Saturday, 20-time All-Star LeBron James declined his $51.4 million player option for 2024-25 with the intent of re-signing. As of now, James even appears to be willing to sign for less than the max in order for the Lakers to use the $12.9 million non-taxpayers MLE, maximizing his chances of winning another championship before his storied career ends. With that being said, as James is only expected to play two or three more years, this could be his final contract.\n\nUpdate: Reran the numbers and used Bronny’s official projection ($1,160,543). LA will be at around $182.3M in salary if LeBron re-signs for the $49.9M max. So he’d have to take a $17(ish) million discount for LA to use $12.9M NTMLE and his 2024-25 salary would begin at ~$33M. https://t.co/36Pu1VzSE3\n\n— Jovan Buha (@jovanbuha) June 29, 2024\n\n\n\n“The type of player that James would be willing to make a financial sacrifice for would be an established veteran playmaker such as James Harden or Klay Thompson, or an established big man to play alongside Anthony Davis such as Jonas Valančiūnas,” reports ESPN’s Dave McMenamin.\n\nWhile $12.9 million isn’t chump change, most of the players that they’re hoping will sign for MLE can get a more lucrative contract elsewhere. In essence, they would have to be willing to take a pay cut as well. Unfortunately for James and the Lakers, these players don’t have nearly as much incentive to do so.\n\nJames Harden may be the most unrealistic target for the Lakers.\n\nTo start, there’s mutual interest between Harden and the Los Angeles Clippers, who the former MVP angled a trade to last offseason. Although the Clippers already had a resurgent Russell Westbrook, Harden’s game has aged more gracefully because it’s based on skill more than athleticism. Yet, it all worked out in the end, as Westbrook’s Crash Bandicoot play style allowed him to be a second unit spark plug.\n\nWith the Clippers, Harden has also staved off criticisms about his decline or character. Indeed, he has a more tranquil environment in L.A. than he had with the Philadelphia 76ers, Brooklyn Nets, or Houston Rockets. So, would he leave a place he’s grown comfortable, where he’s valued, and who could pay him substantially more than the Lakers to team up with James? A team that will have just as many All-Stars as the Clippers if Harden re-signs?\n\nEven if James whispered sweet nothings in Harden’s ear at Kendrick Lamar’s ‘Pop Out’ concert, it’s possible, but improbable.\n\nRevenge is a dish best served cold.\n\nWith that being said, if Klay Thompson wants to get back at the Golden State Warriors for not prioritizing him in free agency, joining the Lakers would be like sticking an ice pick in their heart. Though the Lakers and Warriors don’t have a true rivalry, James is the closest thing Golden State has had to an archenemy.\n\nThompson will likely get better offers from the Sixers, Orlando Magic, or Oklahoma City Thunder. However, those teams don’t give him a chance for payback. Judging by how terse Thompson’s relationship with the Warriors front office is right now, that might be a difference-maker.\n\nThompson does seem petty enough to want to be the source of Golden State’s ire. Yet, his happy-go-lucky personality doesn’t quite mesh with the idea of him being out for blood.\n\nOf the Lakers’ top free agent targets, Jonas Valanciunas is the most feasible addition.\n\nThe 32-year-old is unlikely to be fielding offers much higher than the non-taxpayers MLE at this point in his career. A 12-year NBA veteran, Valanciunas has long since proven himself to be a skilled pivot. Like many European centers, he’s a reliable low-post scorer. Indeed, he’s averaged at least 12.0 points per game every season since 2014-15.\n\nAt 6-foot-11 and 265 pounds, Valanciunas is also a handful on the boards. He ranks fifth among active players in total rebounding rate (20.6 percent) and is particularly effective on the defensive glass. He’s a so-so defender whose lack of foot speed leaves him vulnerable when guarding out in space.\n\nThe main question is whether Valanciunas believes he would fit more with another team. For example, the Thunder need size to complement their hybrid big man as well. However, as L.A. will likely play a slower pace than OKC, the Thunder don’t appear to be a better match.\n\nAccording to Klutch Sports CEO Rich Paul, “if the Lakers are unable to entice a player of that ilk to come to L.A. for the MLE, James will seek the max.”\n\nThe hardball doesn’t stop there.\n\nJames would like to have his deal done before Team USA’s training camp for the Paris Olympics begins next week. As a result, players like Harden and Thompson would be asked to make complicated decisions in a short time. Even if they were considering signing with the Lakers, the process might seem a bit rushed.\n\nPaul George’s decision to become a free agent adds another layer of complexity.\n\nGeorge and Thompson have both drawn interest from the Sixers and Orlando Magic. So, whoever George spurns could make a harder charge at Thompson. For example, if George signs with the Magic, Philadelphia could give Thompson an offer he can’t refuse. As the Sixers have also struck out on OG Anunoby, this is even more likely.\n\nYet, if George does eventually re-sign with the Clippers, Harden has even more of a reason to do the same. Ultimately, everyone is in a holding pattern until George makes a decision. George doesn’t have to rush to make that decision though.\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tQuenton Albertie, a native of Ft.

        "expanded content": "Andy Murray says he is willing to take a risk with his body in order to play one more Wimbledon. A week after undergoing back surgery to remove a cyst, he practised on Saturday for about an hour and remains hopeful, if not totally positive, that he will be able to play some part in this year’s Championships.\n\nThat he was practising at all offers hope, but the next 48 hours will be crucial. If the 37-year-old is unable to play singles, he may still feel able to play doubles with his brother Jamie Murray for the first time in their careers, the pair having been given a wildcard by organisers. Whatever he decides, he is pushing his body to the limit, as he has done throughout his career.\n\n“I need to be able to move properly, which I can’t yet, so let’s see in 48 hours or so,” said Murray, who had been told he could be out for at least six weeks after the operation, perhaps longer. “I don’t know, tough to know how it’s going to progress, really.\n\n“Always when you get surgeries done, generally you get multiple opinions. I wasn’t told that it was going to be 10 days either, but … There are risks associated with what I’m trying to do and I’m willing to take that to try and play.”\n\nThis is meant to be Murray’s last Wimbledon, five years after he returned to the Tour, defying medical opinion after having a metal hip inserted in 2019, an operation that saved his career. Since then, he has made an incredible effort to remain competitive but has struggled to climb the rankings in the way he would have hoped. Finishing his career at the Olympics in Paris is the plan, but that all depends on whether his body can hold up long enough.\n\nMurray has been an example to all British players for almost two decades and there is a renewed sense of positivity around British tennis, with 19 home players in the singles draws, seven by right and 12 by virtue of wildcards, awarded in recognition of their efforts on Tour in the past 12 months.\n\nSign up to The Recap\n\nThe best of our sports journalism from the past seven days and a heads-up on the weekend’s action\n\nafter newsletter promotion\n\nWhile Emma Raducanu’s recent form offers encouragement, that two of them – Jack Draper and Katie Boulter – are seeded for the first time is a real step forward. Draper, who beat Carlos Alcaraz at Queen’s last week, is No 28 in the men’s event while Boulter is No 32 in the women’s singles.\n\nDraper is enjoying being the new leader, in rankings terms at least, having learned from players such as Murray in the past. Now he is feeding off the healthy rivalry with the chasing pack and sharing tips with the likes of Henry Searle, who won the boys’ title last year and received a wildcard for the main draw this year.\n\n“I’ve been lucky to have Andy, Dan [Evans], Cam [Norrie] showing me the way since I was younger. Their professionalism, their discipline, the way they treated me when I was a young player coming up, the respect they gave me is sort of saying, all right, you’re on this journey now, this is how you do it.\n\n“There’s a really good work ethic and camaraderie between the male players. Also on the female side, too, there’s lots of really good talent coming through. We all just want to play well and win matches and do the best we can.”\n\nFor Boulter, being seeded at a grand slam is a breakthrough. “It’s a moment for me to show the dedication I’ve put in these last few years,” she said. “That’s a little pat on the back for me and it’s a start but I also know that I’ve got a long way to go, I’m still starting first round. And I’ve got to beat the person in front of me, which is never easy.”\n\nThis is the archive of The Observer up until 21/04/2025. The Observer is now owned and operated by Tortoise Media."

Thanks for all your emails and for following along to that nervy finish for Cav.\n\nHere’s the report from stage one of the Tour:\n\nGood work from the Astana team to get Cav over the line, he looks alright:\n\nA thumbs up from Mark Cavendish, finishing inside the time cut with just under 10 minutes to spare. 👍 #TDF2024 pic.twitter.com/szr5K5tMOJ\n\nHe’s inside the cutoff, coming in 39mins 12 secs after Bardet. Assuming he’s fine to continue, he’ll be on the start line tomorrow.\n\nA few jersey updates, Abrahamsen will take the polka dots, Van Den Broek gets the green points jersey as the leader in that classification on 33 points and 24-year-old Maxim Van Gils of Lotto-Dstny will take the best young rider’s white jersey.\n\nThe cutoff has been set at just over 49 minutes after the winner, Cavendish has not crossed the line yet but has 22 minutes to make it.\n\nCavendish update: He’s still out on the road, but ITV reckon he’s comfortably within the time limit. I’ll keep you posted on his progress.\n\nHere’s the top ten after stage one:\n\n1. Romain Bardet (FRA) Team DSM-Firmenich PostNL - 5:07:22\n\n2. Frank van den Broek (NED) Team DSM-Firmenich PostNL - same time\n\n3. Wout van Aert (BEL) Team Visma - Lease a Bike +5secs\n\n4. Tadej Pogacar (SLO) UAE Team Emirates - same time\n\n5. Maxim Van Gils (BEL) Lotto - Dstny - same time\n\n6. Alex Aranburu (ESP) Movistar Team - same time\n\n7. Mads Pedersen (DEN) Lidl-Trek - same time\n\n8. Remco Evenepoel (BEL) Soudal-Quick-Step - same time\n\n9. Pello Bilbao (ESP) Bahrain Victorious - same time\n\n10. Alberto Bettiol (ITA) EF Education–EasyPost – same time\n\nHere’s the moment Bardet crossed the line:\n\n🏆 🇫🇷 @romainbardet wins in Rimini! It’s a @dsmfirmpostnl masterpiece!🏆🇫🇷 @romainbardet s’impose à Rimini ! Chef d’oeuvre de l’équipe @dsmfirmpostnl !#TDF2024 pic.twitter.com/8qri9w823N\n\nAs he crossed the line Bardet pointed to his teammate to credit him with delivering the victory, Van Aert finished third on the stage – looks like he’s in form.\n\nThe sprinters couldn’t make an impact and the DSM pair cross 150m ahead of the bunch. What a performance from Van Den Broek, he did the big turns in those last five kilometres.\n\n1km to go: DSM have this!\n\n2km to go: Gap is now ten seconds, DSM still in the lead. Incredible racing!\n\n3km to go: The peloton has the leaders in its sight, gap down to less than 20 seconds.\n\n4km to go: The DSM riders are being encouraged on over team radio, the gap isn’t coming down that quickly now. Maybe this could happen for Bardet? Lidl-Trek is at the front trying to get that split down.\n\n7km to go: DSM efforts looks set to fall short, the gap is now just 36secs. The remanining favourites are you’d think are Pedersen, Ciccone, Bettiol, Van Aert and Pidcock.\n\nQuick explainer on the cutoff rules:\n\nThe time cut varies by stage. It is dependent on the difficulty of the stage and the average speed of the winner. The difficulty of each stage is determined on tiers of one to six, known as a ‘coefficient’. Flat stages get a tier one coefficient rating and that goes up based on difficulty. The average speed of the winner is combined with the stage’s coefficient to determine a percentage by which the cutoff is calculated from leaders.\n\nStage one is rated as third tier coefficient with, so with the average speed so of more than 44kph it looks like the cutoff will be 20% of the winner’s finishing time.\n\n16km to go: A quick Cavendish update, his Astana group is more than 30 minutes back but that’s likely to be OK in terms of the cutoff. Fabio Jakobsen, another sprint favourite with DSM, is with him.\n\n17km to go: Wout van Aert is still with the peloton, we’ll find out how good his legs are if this all comes together.\n\n19km to go: Bardet and Van Den Broek are still pushing at the front but the gap to the peloton has fallen to 1min 20secs.\n\n27km to go: Ineos and Lidl-Trek now on the front of the peloton in a bid to bring back the DSM pair, about half a kilometre to the summit, then it’ll be flat out on the descent to Rimini. Bardet still has a 1min 50 secs lead, he wants that first ever yellow jersey – remarkable given his career that he’s never worn it.\n\n28km to go: Bettiol, Mads Pedersen and Pidcock might all be thinking about a stage win now if the peloton can draw back the DSM riders.\n\n31km to go: Healy has ditched Madouas but is yet to make much of a dent into the lead of the DSM pair. The question now is how much time can Bardet and Van Den Broek put into the peloton? It’s currently hovering around two minutes with 4km to the final summit.\n\n32km to go: Healy has now picked up Madouas but they remain more than a minute behind the DSM riders.\n\n38km to go: Healy is on the descent and is one minute behind Bardet, the peloton are a 1min 45secs further back.\n\n40km to go: Will the DSM riders let Madouas take the latest mountain points in exchange for a bit of help? No, the Groupama-FDJ has blown up and been dropped. Abrahamsen will likely be in the polka dots then.\n\n41km to go: Abrahamsen has gone from the lead group as Bardet and DSM teammate Van Den Broek power on with Madouas in tow. Irishman Ben Healy of EF has gone away from the peloton, can he make a play and bridge over to the leaders who are 1min 06 sec up the road?\n\n49km to go: Bardet latches on to Van Den Broek and the DSM-Firmenich PostNL pair set off in pursuit of Abrahamsen and Madouas at the front. The Uno-X Mobility rider, Abrahamsen, can’t take maximum mountain points this time but he’s probably in the polkadot jersey with those latest additions.\n\n50km to go: Romain Bardet is attacking off the front of the peloton and no one is going with him right now, he’s got 40 secs already and a teammate ahead of him to help out.\n\nEric Farquharson makes a good point on the Olympics:\n\nThe Olympic peloton is virtually half the size of the Tour de France due to IOC restrictions on team sizes. I would say that a stage win or podium places in the Tour are far more influential for future contracts and therefore salary expectations than an Olympic medal.\n\nThis is what I was getting at earlier when I referred to the race as a bit of a crapshoot. Small teams and parcours designed around local landmarks can lead to races where winners can come from anywhere, so not exactly consistent with who is having a good season.\n\n55km to go: The riders have flown down the descent from the Cote de Barbotto and steaming towards the Cote de San Leo. The breakaway, down to five riders without Izagirre, leads by the peloton by 2mins 18secs.\n\n71km to go: We’re in pirate country and someone has painted the Italian legend’s name all over the road on the climb, maybe inspired and with Izagirre gone Abrahamsen bursts away takes maxium mountain points from Madouas and Van Den Broek.\n\nWilliam Fotheringham’s latest read on Marco Pantani is well worth your time:\n\n72km to go: Izagirre going out the back of the lead group, he’s looked strong most of the day but perhaps those efforts earlier have sapped the legs. With the peloton now just 2mins 40secs behind the break, he might be seeing the GC teams quite soon.\n\nMore on the Olympic question from Martin O’Donovan-Wright:\n\nIn the professional peleton, for the vast majority of riders, an Olympic medal would certainly be regarded below not only a successful Tour de France (podium, or stage wins), but also the Giro, and certainly all the monuments. The sport is admirably self-contained, always with a nod to the history of these illustrious races.\n\nThat’s how I’d view it too and I imagine most hardcore cycling fans would feel the same. Although track cycling of course is vastly different.\n\n74km to go: The peloton has brought down the gap to the main group to 3mins 44secs. UAE, Pogačar’s team, have taken over at the front the chase group after a big shift from EF-Education Easypost to cut that time down to the front of the race.\n\nClaus Lund asks a good question:\n\nWhat is going on with the big names such as Tadej Pogačar and Jonas Vingegaard. The latter in his first race after his very bad accident and Pogačar looking to win after two years’ frustration. How are they performing today so far?\n\nWe’ve had one update on Vingegaard by way of the team radio, which suggested he was feeling fine on the first category two climb of the stage – that is good news on his return. Very little to say about Pogačar so far, he’s well-placed in the peloton. Both had full teams around them in the main group.\n\nNicolas De Smet has an answer to the Olympics question:\n\nOlympics are great but I think that a Tour de France win (prestigious stage or overall rankings) trumps that.\n\nWho remembers Olympic gold? Who remembers Tour de France?\n\nAlso fairly few riders are qualified for the Olympics.\n\n88km to go: Breakaway has a five-minute gap as they head towards Cote de Barbotto, the stage’s next category two climb. EF are on the front of the peloton but the gap is holding firm.\n\nIf anyone has thoughts on Andrew’s question, or anything else, do get in touch.\n\nGreat question from Andrew Benton via email:\n\nDo you think the riders will take fewer risks this year? I imagine a fair number will be representing their countries at the Olympics, and would be loath to risk missing their chance because of injury, whatever team orders say.\n\nA look at the list of medallists for the road race going back to Sydney is quite baffling – Jan Ullrich, Paolo Bettini, Samuel Sánchez, Alexander Vinokourov, Greg Van Avermaet and Richard Carapaz – it’s probably an illustration of the varied courses set out by Olympic hosts. I’ve never been convinced it’s that big a draw for riders, just because it’s a bit of a crapshoot. I suppose the big question for me is who leads the Slovenian team?"

She had to be helped by her coach and the medical staff.\n\nJones has already been dealing with a shoulder injury she suffered before the Xfinity U.S. Championships that took place in Fort Worth, Texas from May 30 to June 2. The injury resulted in her withdrawal from the competition hours before the event was set to begin. Jones petitioned to compete at the 2024 Paris Olympics trials despite her shoulder injury, which was ultimately accepted. The injury she sustained on Friday, however, could keep her from competing at the Olympics.\n\nRead more: Earn up to 6% Cash Back When You Pay for Streaming Services\n\nJones began the season at the Core Hydration Classic, otherwise known as the U.S. Classic, which took place between May 17 and 18 at the XL Center in Hartford, Connecticut.\n\nDuring the event, Jones secured a silver medal on the all-around behind Simone Biles. She also received the gold medal over Biles for the uneven bars, and tied with Kaliya Lincoln for the silver medal in the floor event, also behind Biles.\n\nJones would have more than likely been a lock for the 2024 Paris Olympics team, but the injury she has sustained could keep her once again from competing at the Olympics.\n\nJones is a six-time world championship medalist but has yet to punch a ticket to the Olympics. When she attempted to make the team in 2021, she disappointed at the Olympic trials in St. Louis, placing 10th. All nine team members who placed above Jones would make the team as competitors and alternates.\n\nJones injuring herself moments before the 2024 Olympics trials is heartbreaking, to say the least. While she was likely hoping to finally break through and make it to the biggest stage for gymnastics, she could have to wait another four years. The USAG should provide updates on Jones sooner rather than later.\n\nJames Brizuela is a contributing sports writer located in Los Angeles.

        "expanded content": "Before India’s T20 World Cup final against South Africa, photojournalist Frédéric Noy looks at the role that cricket plays on the sub-continent\n\nAccording to Ashis Nandy, an Indian political psychologist, “cricket is an Indian game accidentally discovered by the British”. In a 2018 survey, the International Cricket Council (ICC) said as much, estimating that more than 90% of the world’s one billion cricket fans live on the Indian subcontinent.\n\nThe first appearance of cricket in India dates back to 1721 with a match between English sailors in the port of Cambay, or perhaps further south, at Tankari Bandar, on the soggy banks of the River Vishwamitri, where the currents would have forced one of Her Gracious Majesty’s ships to wait a fortnight for the tide to rise. Regardless of the exact location, the consensus is that to kill time, the crew played cricket under the eyes of intrigued and attentive locals. “I read about it in the paper, and my father and grandfather told me about it. As a child, I knew that the British had played cricket down by the river in 1721. Cricket was born in Tankari Bandar,” says village chief Ranjit Sikh with aplomb.\n\nAlthough it seems that the British had no intention of teaching the laws of the subtle game to the natives, during the 19th century cricket was played only by the Indian elite, anxious to curry favour with the colonisers. This patrician adoption of the game helped it to spread throughout the country, as well as raising its profile. By the end of the 19th century, the sport’s status as the preserve of the upper classes was fading as players from lower castes and disadvantaged communities began to play and make their mark.\n\nOne such player was Palwankar Baloo, a Dalit from the Chamaar caste of tanners, at the bottom of the Hindu social hierarchy. He was the first star of Indian cricket, and is now considered a legend – but throughout his career, which began in 1896, he was never seen as an equal and faced a great deal of discrimination. For example, at the Pune ground where he made his debut, at tea time he was brought his beverage in a disposable cup, which he could not drink with the other players in the pavilion. His lunch was served at a separate table. If he wanted to wash his face, a lower-caste assistant would bring him water from the side. At the end of his career, he became close to Dr Ambedkar, the main drafter of the Constitution and revered leader of the untouchables. Portraits of the latter hang on the walls of SG (Sanspareils Greenlands), a giant cricket goods manufacturer in the town of Meerut. The workers, most of whom are from the lower classes, are a reminder that cricket and social aspiration are hardly strangers to each other.\n\nWorkers sew gloves in the factory of Sanspareils Greenlands (SG), which is India’s largest manufacturer and exporter of cricket equipment. With 3,000 employees, SG is based in Meerut, a town in Uttar Pradesh, nicknamed the city of sport because more than 3,000 equipment manufacturers of all sizes are based there.\n\nA worker checks the cork spheres that are the heart of cricket balls. Dense and elastic, cork ensures the best possible combination of bounce and durability, two essential qualities of cricket balls; The famous red cricket balls, reserved for international Test matches and first-class matches, that are used in India are produced exclusively by SG.\n\nA worker assembles the different parts of the handle of a cricket bat, made up of sections of cane wood sawn lengthways and then glued back together; Cork and/or rubber are glued between the different slices to absorb the shock of the bats, workers polish cricket bats with sand paper, the final touch in the manufacturing process (above); Workers affix the brand’s SG stickers to the body of finished bats before they are packed for shipment to Mumbai, throughout India and abroad (below).\n\nIn New Ahmedabad Sports, Mumbai’s most renowned sports and cricket supply shop with over 85 years’ experience, two brothers are examining bats. The prices of bats start at INR 5,000 (£47) and can go up to INR 200,000 (£1,897), depending on the quality of the wood and the style.\n\nBut show cricket is not just for the elite. From its very beginnings in Mumbai (then Bombay), it was popular. Huge crowds turned out to see the first Parsi and Hindu teams take on their so-called colonial ‘masters,’ and each other. This reflected the time and place: the rapid growth of Bombay’s textile factories gave rise to a new class of organised workers with a minimum of free time and money. Perhaps it also reflects the hierarchical nature of traditional Indian society …\n\nOver time, cricket infused the fabric of India’s cultural mosaic, to the point of escaping the British Empire by becoming a tool in the struggle against colonial domination. The pitch was both a theatre of imperial power and a showcase for Indian resistance. In the context of ‘peaceful’ decolonisation, cricket became the symbolic arena for independence aspirations, with matches organised against the occupying power serving to stir up a feeling of unity. In 1947, when independence was proclaimed, some Anglophobic nationalists called for the disappearance of the game in the wake of the departure of its promoters. The British did indeed leave, but cricket remained firmly rooted.\n\nIn the early days, a cricket match was played for an unlimited time, then for five days until the 1970s. In 1975, the first one-day World Cup was held in England. In 1983, India’s victory triggered an explosion of fervour across the sub-continent that has never abated since.\n\nIn the early 2000s, England and Wales introduced a new form of match, shorter and more rhythmic, to match the duration of other team sports such as football: Twenty20 (T20), which lasts around three hours. Thanks to this new format, global cricket enjoyed a fantastic boom. Riding the T20 wave, the Board of Control of Cricket in India (BCCI), cricket’s governing body, invented the Indian Premier League in 2008, creating eight teams in the form of franchises sold to the highest bidder. Since then, 10 teams based in major cities have been vying for the title.\n\nCoaches or private individuals rent pitches for 7,000 rupees (£56) on which paid maidan employees set up training nets. The coaches earn money by selling private lessons to players of all ages.\n\nA group of players warming up at the Vasoo Paranjape Cricket Academy, where they train for an hour and a half from Monday to Friday. There are many academies in Mumbai, run by local coaches and also by many former players, but those with their own grounds and adequate facilities are in the minority; the others are all set up on the maidans.\n\nAnd so, in an irony of history and a keen sense of business, a sport that was once the exclusive preserve of the colonial elite is now the national passion of the formerly colonised, enabling India to become the world’s superpower, with two world titles to its name in 1983 and 2011. It is a passion, an obsession even, that has its roots in a desire for cohesion. “In India, there are different sects, different communities, different language barriers. But cricket is a game that unites everyone to a certain extent, when it is played together,” explains P S Chari, director of the theatre in Vadodara, a town in Gujarat.\n\nThe geographical origins of Indian cricket lie in the once vast expanse of green land at the southern tip of Mumbai. All that remains of the area, which was once ready for use to fire cannons at the French if they attacked Bombay during the colonial race, are a few maidans – open spaces used as parade grounds or for events – surrounded by urban development. On a daily basis, these pitches are the breeding ground for the talents of tomorrow.\n\n“The fact that many of India’s great cricketers come from Mumbai is due to the tradition of passing on the baton between us, the old players, and the new generation that we support. It is common to see coaches on the training grounds and in the academies teaching their technique, giving advice, revealing their secrets and sharing their experience with the youngsters,” says the coach Ramesh Vazge, who officiates on the New Hind at Gymkhana Matunga. A sacred den, a maidan is entered with devotion. Before they reach adulthood, most players bow to touch the pitch as a sign of respect after passing through the gate. “In India, cricket is a veritable religion. One person in two plays. In this country, it’s more than just a sport,” laughs Khanjan, a young player.\n\nBatters practice at 8am at Cross Maidan in the historic Churchgate district of south Mumbai, protected by nets set up at dawn by paid employees who sleep there. When entering the maidan, players usually touch the ground as a sign of respect. This gesture is practised systematically by young players, and takes on less visible forms as the players become adults. A young player perfects his batting technique under the watchful eye of his personal coach, at Cross Maidan.\n\nA player shouts encouragement to his team, batting during a match in the MI Junior inter-school tournament on Azad Maidan in Mumbai. The aim of MI Junior is to enable budding cricketers (boys and girls) from schools in Mumbai and other cities in Maharashtra to discover and experience competitive cricket. Azad Maidan is a triangular-shaped sports ground that regularly hosts inter-school cricket matches, and hosted the first cricket Test match in India’s history on 15 December 1933. Temporary stands were erected to accommodate a record crowd of 50,000, with tickets selling for five times the usual price.\n\nA bat repairman sands a broken bat at his stall which he set under a tree at Azad Maidan.\n\nCricket is the only sport born in the west whose centre has moved to the Indian subcontinent. This made the home defeat to Australia in the World Cup final on 19 November 2023, watched by more than 300 million people, all the more bitter. Fair play to India’s true fans, who recognise that the performance of the “Men in Blue” (the nickname of the national team) was not up to the standard they had set themselves.\n\nThe defeat deprived one spectator of a moment of hubris: the prime minister, Narendra Modi, whose party, the BJP (Bharatiya Janata Party), uses the sport “as a vehicle for muscular nationalism”, according to Sharda Ugra, a journalist with ESPNcricinfo. “Control is exercised not only through senior officials linked to the ruling party, but also through the use of Indian cricket to spread their political message,” she explains. While Modi’s government is not the first to use the sport for political purposes, his populist party has forged closer links with the governing body.\n\nBeyond the national horizon, the Olympic Games. In October 2023, at a meeting in Mumbai, the IOC (International Olympic Committee) approved the inclusion of cricket in the 2028 Games in Los Angeles. The organisers proposed a six-team event, but no decision was made on the final number or qualification arrangements. In fact, it’s not so much the competition itself that counts, as the hope of helping the Games reach the three-billion viewer mark. “People don’t really watch the Olympics in South Asia. They know Usain Bolt and that’s it,” says Yash, a 22-year-old player at England’s famous Slough Cricket Club, who lived in India until he was 18. “Only well-to-do families watch them, not villagers. But now that cricket has taken off, 100% of people will start watching them.”\n\nThe love of the game has already digested the hangover from the lost final. Enthusiasts, children, teenagers and adults turn up at the crack of dawn on the maidans, on Juhu beach and in the parks, tirelessly re-enacting what Indian anthropologist Arjun Appadurai calls “the indigenisation of cricket”, and recounting how this sport, a vehicle for the great Victorian values such as loyalty, fair play and self-control, ended up being totally reappropriated culturally, becoming the herald of Indian values.\n\nOval Maidan is a large, popular recreation ground in the Churchgate district of South Mumbai where political gatherings and religious functions are prohibited and informal cricket matches are organised by groups of friends."

        "expanded content": "Nine’s Wide World of Sports\n\nAustralian hurdler Alanah Yukich is hoping a wild globe-trotting bid to qualify for the Paris Games, in which she raced five times in five different countries within 16 days, has her on the cusp of an Olympic debut.\n\nThe 26-year-old returned home to Texas this week with an incredible story to tell, having pinged from the United States to The Bahamas, then to Spain, then Switzerland, then Poland in a tick over two weeks, completing one race in each country with two goals in mind. One goal was nailing the Olympic entry standard for the women's 400m hurdles. The other was stockpiling crucial world ranking points.\n\nThe three final races of the trip fell on consecutive days — June 21, June 22 and June 23 — as she shot from country to country acutely aware that track and field's qualification deadline, June 30, was drawing agonisingly closer.\n\nREAD MORE: Burton's brilliance seals 'thrilling' golden point victory\n\nREAD MORE: Cancer found after Olympic dream crushed by seizures\n\nREAD MORE: Rival questions Jake Paul's extreme weight jump\n\n\"I got back to Texas and my coach was like, 'How's your body?', and I was like, 'Honestly, my body is fine',\" Yukich tells Wide World of Sports over Zoom.\n\n\"It's my head from the caffeine withdrawals — I'm having mad caffeine withdrawals now.\"\n\nYukich did not hit the entry standard — her best time of the frantic trip, which is now her lifetime best, fell 0.30 of a second short of the 54.85 seconds required — but she's feeling good about her qualification chances after gobbling up a huge number of world ranking points.\n\nAustralia's Alanah Yukich just completed a wild 16-day bid to qualify for the Paris Olympics. Supplied\n\nHustling around on most days off a dreadful shortage of sleep, but fuelled by adrenaline, coffee and energy drinks, she raced in the USA state of Georgia, the capital city of The Bahamas, Madrid, Geneva and the Polish city of Poznan.\n\n\"I was so caught up in competition that I kind of forgot that I was in another country, just because my mindset was, 'Yep, one race done, recover, do what I can to get ready for the next',\" Yukich recalls.\n\n\"I think the biggest wake-up call was the languages. I couldn't figure out what language I was trying to speak.\n\n\"I'm really proud of myself looking back on it all.\n\n\"It's a mental [challenge] more than anything.\"\n\nAlanah Yukich in action in her bid to qualify for the Olympics. Supplied\n\nYukich has run her final race of the qualification period. Now all she can do is hope the 400m hurdlers contesting Olympic trials over the final days of the qualification period do not send her tumbling down the world rankings.\n\nOne reason she was left in a mad rush late in the qualification period was that earlier in the window she'd been focusing on the 400m flat. She wanted to race for Australia in the 4x400m at the World Athletics Relays in The Bahamas in May. Athletics Australia told her she'd have to log some respectable times in the 400m flat to earn selection for the World Athletics Relays. She banked some impressive times, then raced at the World Athletics Relays, but Australia failed to qualify for the Paris Games in the 4x400m.\n\nYukich says the toughest turnaround of her 16-day trip was the Madrid-Geneva leg. She raced at 8pm local time in Madrid. By the time she'd arrived at her hotel, it was midnight. By the time she'd drifted off to sleep, it was 3am. She was then up at 5am to catch an early flight. The flight took about two hours, buying her another two hours of sleep. She then raced in Geneva at 1pm. Desperate for a spike of energy before another one-lap dash over the hurdles, she got a Red Bull ordered to the track. It cost A$25.\n\nAlanah Yukich receives the baton from Mikeala Selaidinakos at the World Athletics Relays in The Bahamas. Sonya Maleter/Athletics Australia\n\n\"That race was a blur, that one didn't really happen,\" Yukich says with a laugh.\n\n\"I remember finishing the race and calling my coach, and I was like, 'What now? Poland, there's a meet in Poland. Can we get in that?'. She made some calls and within 10 minutes of making a call a lane opened up. I was booking my flight for the next morning and I was out.\"\n\nYukich has Croatian grandparents but grew up on a farm in Gingin, a small town some 60 kilometres north-west of Perth, before moving to America to be a student-athlete at the University of Texas at San Antonio (UTSA). She graduated last year and has continued to live and train in Texas, where she's now coached by Rose Monday, who was Team USA's head coach for women's track and field at Tokyo 2020.\n\nYukich has made extraordinary progress since joining Monday's stable last year, whittling her 400m hurdles personal best down from 57.00 seconds to 55.15, which she clocked in Madrid on her dash around the globe. She had never cracked the 57-second barrier before the trip, but proceeded to rip times of 55.67, 55.33, 55.15, 55.94 and 55.40.\n\nAlanah Yukich is not only a track and field athlete, but a model. Supplied\n\nYukich is also a model — she says modelling is her \"creative outlet\" and she wants to inspire more athletes to become the face of a brand — but athletics takes priority.\n\nEarly in July, she will find out if her astonishing bid to qualify for the Olympics has her bound for Paris.\n\n\"It's a nervous wait,\" Yukich says.\n\n\"No one's safe. The sport is unpredictable.\n\n\"I think because I've gotten this far the universe is on my side.\"\n\n12 minutes ago\n\n41 minutes ago\n\n1 hour ago\n\n© 2025 Nine Entertainment Co."

        "expanded content": "Manchester City's summer transfer activity has yet to get going as the Blues bide their time in the market.\n\nPep Guardiola's men clinched a fourth successive Premier League title in May but fell short in Europe after being knocked out by Real Madrid in the semi-finals of the Champions League. The Blues will once again seek to challenge on both fronts this season.\n\nCity have an XI and a squad the envy of most clubs around the world but there remains work to do for Guardiola and Co ahead of a campaign which brings an expanded Champions League and an end of season Club World Cup in the States. With that in mind, here are the three biggest transfer issues facing City over the next few weeks.\n\nALSO READ: City could have eight 'new signings' under their nose that can save them millions\n\nALSO READ: Man City's dream subs after £140m transfer splurge, Jack Grealish call and Bruno Guimaraes decision\n\nJoe Bray\n\nThe stance on De Bruyne will be the same as the one for any senior player - if they want to leave and present a suitable offer, then City won't stand in their way. However, De Bruyne showed at the end of the season that even when he isn't fully firing he is still capable of scoring brilliant goals and winning games on his own. City shouldn't give that up too easily.\n\nThe easiest way to show they want him to stay would be a new contract, but with a year left and De Bruyne turning 33 on Friday, patience is probably the best way forward. After some medium-to-long-term injuries in recent years, even De Bruyne isn't exempt from City's pragmatic approach to contracts for their older players.\n\nAnd if he decides to leave, then City would need to be looking for a successor now anyway for the coming seasons. As much as it would be a shame to see him go, it wouldn't be the devastating loss it could have been when the Belgian was younger.\n\nSimon Bajkowski\n\nDe Bruyne's situation may be accelerated by the Saudi clubs interested in signing him, although if he stays at the club that deadline will reset. Fernandinho, Ilkay Gundogan, Pep Guardiola and others have all gone into the final year of their deals at City before and renewed, so entering the final 12 months with De Bruyne won't signal a decision either way.\n\nWhat City will have to work out is how central De Bruyne can be to their plans, for next season and beyond. He struggled with injuries last year, and when he returned while his goal and assist contributions were extraordinary it didn't always feel a natural fit with both him and Phil Foden trying to lead the team in the middle.\n\nJB: It's not so much that City need a replacement for Rodri, but more an appropriate back-up option. The Kalvin Phillips experiment failed spectacularly, and even when Fernandinho was winding down he was often used at centre-back. Maybe the way forward is the Ilkay Gundogan solution - a player who can play at both number eight and number six.\n\nMateo Kovacic got better as the season went on, so could he be moulded into a more defensive midfielder during pre-season in order to support Rodri and give himself more game-time? Aside from that, City could promote Mahamadou Susoho or Jacob Wright for late cameos to ease the burden on Rodri, or alternatively try and sign a cheaper midfielder who would be content with playing back-up.\n\nThe final option is Rico Lewis. He'd prefer to play number eight and Rodri's role is completely different to his current inverted full-back role even if he occupies similar spaces, but he is certainly versatile enough to play in a double pivot with someone else.\n\nSB: City really need to buy somebody. They didn't really listen to Rodri last summer when he said he needed rest, and they were badly exposed when he missed games through suspension last season.\n\nThe best solution to Rodri could be John Stones, although Stones wasn't available enough last season to be deemed a reliable option for such a crucial spot. There are a number of players already in the squad and the academy who can fill in, but for peace of mind for both supporters and Rodri himself a fresh face would go a long way to bolstering that role.\n\nJB: Joao Cancelo and Kalvin Phillips are the main two names who stand out. Both seem unwanted at City, but finding a buyer for permanent exits may be more difficult. Barcelona surely can't afford Cancelo, while reported interest in Phillips hasn't materialised into anything concrete just yet.\n\nLoans may have to suffice for both in a quiet market, while Sergio Gomez is another player who looks likely to leave. His Olympics call-up during pre-season moves him further away from an unlikely turnaround in his City fortunes.\n\nAs well as De Bruyne, there has been talk over Bernardo Silva and Ederson leaving, but both are under contract and any noise has softened since the end of the season. Further exits are likely to come from the academy or loan players. Liam Delap, James McAtee and Callum Doyle are the standout names in that category.\n\nSB: One of City's strengths in the Guardiola era has been moving players on, even when it has been difficult. Club legends Sergio Aguero and David Silva have left while significant money has been made on Raheem Sterling, Gabriel Jesus, and Oleksandr Zinchenko.\n\nFancy free takeaway delivery, exclusive discounts, free music streaming and access to some of the best sports documentaries being made? These are just a few of the perks of Amazon Prime. Usually £8.99 a month, you can now get a 30-day free trial just in time for Amazon Prime Day, which brings the sites best deals of the year exclusively to Prime members.\n\nAt the minute, it seems as though there won't be any first-team departures unless De Bruyne, Silva or Ederson agitate to leave. That can hardly be questioned given City won the league again last season, but the pressure will be back on the squad to deliver.\n\nAt Reach and across our entities we and our partners use information collected through cookies and other identifiers from your device to improve experience on our site, analyse how it is used and to show personalised advertising.

        "expanded content": "One of the better teams in the 2024 Paris Olympic Games is going to be without a key figure due to NBA politics. Andrew Wiggins, who was set to be a member of Team Canada's men's basketball team, will no longer represent his country as the Golden State Warriors are barring him from participating due to health concerns.\n\nThe Toronto Star's Doug Smith broke the news ahead of Team Canada opening their training camp on Friday night.\n\nThe Athletic's John Hollinger, provided a more in-depth analysis of the move by the Warriors, giving context to why they're preventing Wiggins from playing in the Olympics.\n\n“Warriors blocking him due to a medical issue, which they can do if there's a legit health reason (as opposed to \"we don't feel like letting you play\").” - John Hollinger\n\nThis confirms that the Warriors are set on trading Wiggins before the start of the 2024-25 season. The former top overall pick was a valuable piece on Golden State's 2022 NBA championship roster but has been unable to live up to the level of production he once put forth.\n\n The entire situation with Wiggins' current relationship with the Warriors isn't entirely his fault. It was known that the Canadian forward had to take several leaves of absence from the team due to personal matters that he had to tend to. The details of his matters were not disclosed to the public.\n\nDespite the unfortunate reality of life's unexpected occurrences, Wiggins simply wasn't producing at the level that the Warriors required him to.\n\nAndrew Wiggins 2023-24 Season Stats\n\nCategory\n\nStats\n\nPTS\n\n13.2\n\nREB\n\n4.5\n\nAST\n\n1.7\n\nSTL\n\n0.6\n\nFG%\n\n44.9\n\nIn the 2023-24 season, Wiggins had the worst year of his career. He averaged a career-low 13.2 points per game while being regulated to the bench for the majority of the season. Before this past season, Wiggins never came off the bench but played 12 games as part of the Warriors' second unit last season.\n\nIt was clear that the Warriors were going to make changes ahead of the 2024-25 season, following a disappointing finish, missing the 2024 NBA postseason. Wiggins isn't the only player that may be on his way out the door, as franchise legend, Klay Thompson is rumored to have played his last game in San Francisco.\n\nThe window for contention is the lowest it's been in the Stephen Curry era, as the rest of the Western Conference is getting better by the day. Even young teams, such as the San Antonio Spurs, will eventually reach their stride and become postseason staples.\n\nGolden State has a lot of areas to address before they're able to replicate the same success they experienced in 2022, which may not be possible.\n\nGolden State is potentially willing to trade for, and extend, the veteran forward.\n\nWe want to hear from you!

He was picked as USA Basketball’s male athlete of the year for 2022, the youngest player to ever win that honor.\n\nAlso on the select team: Payton Pritchard of the NBA champion Boston Celtics, Miami’s Jaime Jaquez Jr., Detroit’s Jalen Duren, Orlando’s Jalen Suggs, Golden State teammates Trayce Jackson-Davis and Brandin Podziemski, Houston teammates Jabari Smith Jr. and Amen Thompson, Charlotte’s Brandon Miller, New Orleans’ Trey Murphy, Sacramento’s Keegan Murray, Utah’s Micah Potter, Nigel Hayes-Davis of Turkish club Fenerbahce and longtime USA Basketball standout Langston Galloway.\n\n“As a former member of the USA select team, I know how important and fun this opportunity is for each of these players,” said Grant Hill, USA Basketball Men’s National Team managing director. “There is a tremendous amount of talent on this select squad with the significant job of helping the 2024 USA Men’s National Team as they begin their journey to the Olympics. Each of these athletes will play a role in our preparation as we also develop the national team pipeline for the future.”\n\nThe team will be coached by Orlando Magic coach Jamahl Mosley, with Indiana Pacers assistant Jim Boylen and Purdue coach Matt Painter on his staff. They’ll work in concert with the Olympic team coaching staff — head coach Steve Kerr of Golden State, assistants Erik Spoelstra of Miami and Tyronn Lue of the Los Angeles Clippers, and Gonzaga’s Mark Few.\n\n\n\n\n“At the end of the day, this is an opportunity that you can’t pass up,” Jaquez Jr. said. “Coach Spo is on the staff and being able to compete against all these guys and these players, to be in a gym with all of them, like I said it’s something that you can’t pass up.”\n\nPlans call for the select team to work with the Olympic team head-to-head for the first three days of practice — July 6 through July 8 — in Las Vegas. What typically happens at that point is a handful of select teamers will be invited to remain with the Olympic team and travel with them to Abu Dhabi, where Olympic preparations will continue with more practices and two exhibitions.\n\n“It’s our job to push those guys and make them better and prepare them for the Olympics,” Jaquez Jr. said. “It’s a great opportunity.”\n\n___\n\nAP Summer Olympics: https://apnews.com/hub/2024-paris-olympic-games\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCopyright 2025 The Associated Press.

This weekend he returns to Manchester as one of the Olympic trials’ least likely headline attractions after a shock 9.95sec run when he became the first European to claim the NCAA 100m title in the United States.\n\nThe 21-year-old had all but given up on athletics during his first year at Lancaster University, but has excelled since moving his studies across the Atlantic where he is guided by the nine-time Olympic champion Carl Lewis at the University of Houston, drastically improving his personal best from 10.17sec last year.\n\n“Being a late bloomer it was difficult to find a lot of places to accept me,” said Hinchliffe of his decision to leave Lancashire for Texas. “I was just a regular student in a small place without an athletics track.”\n\nDarren Campbell, the UK Athletics sprint coach, has described Hinchliffe as a “special talent”. But his British-leading time will not secure an Olympic spot unless he finishes in the top two this weekend, with the absent 100m world bronze medallist Zharnel Hughes certain to be given the third discretionary place if he recovers from injury in time for the Paris Games.\n\nOther sub-10sec rivals include Jeremiah Azu, Reece Prescod, Eugene Amo-Dadzie and CJ Ujah. “It’s going to be electric,” said Campbell.\n\nA number of Britain’s leading lights are using the event to work on different elements of their race plans for Paris, safe in the knowledge that they, like Hughes, will be awarded discretionary spots by the selectors to line up in the French capital.\n\nThe Olympic and world 800m silver medallist Keely Hodgkinson – now a firm gold-medal favourite after the USA’s defending champion Athing Mu fell at the US trials – will test her speed over the shorter 400m; world 1,500m champion Josh Kerr will do likewise over 800m; and Matthew Hudson-Smith will compete over 200m instead of his world silver-winning distance of 400m.\n\nTheir decision not to contest their main events leaves remaining Team GB hopefuls in those races facing the ruthless scenario of finishing in the top two to avoid their only taste of Paris coming from a supermarket croissant.\n\nThat brutal equation could affect the 17-year-old 800m prodigy Phoebe Gill, who last month clocked the second-fastest under-18 time in history, behind only a highly suspect Chinese mark from 1993. If she is to make the Olympics before entering her last year at secondary school she must beat either Jemma Reekie or Alex Bell, who both ran in the Tokyo 2020 final.\n\nKerr’s grip on the final discretionary 1500m spot means his predecessor as world champion, Jake Wightman, is unlikely to compete in his preferred event in Paris after a minor injury ruled him out of this weekend’s trials. His Olympic hopes now appear to lie in the selectors’ hands over 800m."

The hold in my right hand felt a bit slippery, so I didn’t want to risk anything. My feet position also felt kind of weird, I needed to think about what to do, but luckily, I stuck and didn’t dryfire or anything.\n\n“This was my last World Cup before the Olympics. I will go home and take some time to rest, and then train until Paris 2024!”\n\nJakob Schubert (AUT), first with 49+:\n\n“Climbing here at home is always different, it’s always special, and this route today was exceptionally special because it was such a crazy fight from halfway up. Every move I felt like I was going to fall. I might have not been the best climber on the route tonight, but I was the best fighter, and that’s what brought me to victory. And it was also only possible because of the crowd.\n\n“I’m always really focused and don’t hear too much while I climb, I would say. I wouldn’t recognise which song was playing, but it was crazy loud when I made that move and I immediately knew that that was probably the victory. From there I felt like I could almost enjoy it… I mean, not really, because I was way too pumped.”\n\nAmagasa Sohta (JPN), 1st with three tops and three zones:\n\n“I can’t believe it, it feels like a dream! My performance today was very good, almost perfect. Now I will skip Lead and focus on the event in Prague. Arigato!”\n\nElias Arriagada Krüger (GER), fourth with one top and four zones:\n\n\"I am over the moon. It's nothing I would have expected, but after training for it for so so many years, it finally happened. I trained a lot with the other strong guys, Yannick [Flohé], Alex [Megos], Jakob [Schubert], now I'm glad and extremely thankful that I made it.\"\n\nJanja Garnbret (SLO), 1st with four tops and four zones:\n\n“I was a little bit stressed today, to be honest. First, I very much enjoyed the semi-final today, it was a hard round, the boulders were very hard, but this is what we train for. The final felt a little bit easier, I needed to stay focused until the end, and I’m happy that I managed to do it, I’m happy for the last boulder which was the hardest. It was a great test before Paris, I feel great.\n\n“Youngsters are coming, I’m not that young anymore! It would be sad if no-one would be coming after me. I always try to stay focused and sharp to beat them.”\n\nFanny Gibert (FRA), fourth with one top and two zones\n\n“I don’t know, it’s just crazy! I came back from so far. It’s been hard to keep believing in it. I like when the rounds are difficult, because they give you the chance to show your real abilities in one style, and your mental ability to stay focused until the end, never give up. That is my best skill, I guess. The aim for the final is to keep the same spirit, climb at my best, just like I did in qualification and semi-final.”\n\nColin Duffy (USA), fifth with five top and five zones:\n\n“I had a fun time on the boulders, Kind of physical style which I enjoy, and I think I was in a good headspace. I love Innsbruck, it is the site of my first Youth World Championships, one of my special moments. Every year it is a pleasure to visit and I’m excited to continue the competition.”\n\nValentina Aguado (ARG), 73rd with zero tops and three zones:\n\n“Qualification was not good for me. At this event especially, there are always a lot of athletes competing and the setting is always hard. At least I had fun on the mats today and went really close to top three of the boulders. It is not enough to say that it was a good round, but at least I’m enjoying the atmosphere of the World Cup in Innsbruck.\n\n“I have been travelling a lot, I arrived in Europe at the beginning of the year, it’s been a long time since I’ve been in Argentina. I miss my family, and I miss my home a lot. I decided to take this challenge of trying to qualify for the Olympics, and I knew that my bast chance was to stay and train here in Europe, because Argentina is not the best place for training. I have been to France, Italy, now Austria, I have competed in China, in the United States, then again in China for the OQS, and Budapest. I will stay in Europe until September.”\n\n@2025 ifsc-climbing.org All Rights Reserved"

(Getty Images: David Ramos)\n\nA historic Tour de France is set to get underway in Italy this weekend, with a genuine modern great hoping to achieve something that few have attempted, let alone achieved in the sport's illustrious history.\n\nTadej Pogačar, winner of this year's Giro d'Italia, is aiming to become the first man in 26 years to win the Giro-Tour double.\n\nStanding in his way is the two-time defending champion Jonas Vingegaard Hansen, named in Visma-Lease a Bike squad despite the appalling injuries he suffered at the Tour of the Basque Country earlier this year.\n\nBut it's not just these two winners of the last four Tours de France who are expected to be in contention.\n\nThere's four-time grand tour winner Primož Roglič, who also claimed his second Critérium du Dauphiné victory earlier this month backed by new team Bora-Hansgrohe, while 2022 World Champion and Vuelta winner Remco Evenepoel is also in the mix, although he will have to hope to put some of his wretched recent fortune behind him to contest properly.\n\nThen there's two-time grand tour winner Egan Bernal, who is on the return from life-threatening injuries suffered in 2022 and leads a strong Ineos-Grenadiers team.\n\nTadej Pogačar wants to win two grand tours this season. (Getty Images: Tim de Waele)\n\nThe list of names to have achieved something approaching cycling's holy grail is a list of the sport's greatest names.\n\nFausto Coppi (twice). Jacques Anquetil. Eddie Merckx (three times). Bernard Hinault (twice). Stephen Roche. Miguel Indurain (twice) and Marco Pantani.\n\nIt is indisputable that Pogačar has the verve, panache and skill to join them — his insatiable appetite to win across grand tours and one day races alike has seen him referred to by Merckx's old nickname of \"Cannibal\", but with a twist, \"Cannibale Gentile\".\n\nTadej Pogačar has been called \"unique\", \"insane\" and \"on a different level\" throughout the Giro d'Italia as he made a mockery of the first grand tour of the season. His indisputable talent is one that deserves all the accolades.\n\nThe parallels between Pog and Pantani were firmly established during this year's Giro d'Italia, a near-uncontested romp to victory in which Pogačar proved he was a cut above the rest of the opposition.\n\nOn stage 2, Pogačar repeated a feat achieved by Pantani on the infamous 1999 Giro by overcoming a puncture at the foot of the steep 11 kilometre climb to Santuario di Oropa before powering past the entire field to win the stage.\n\nPogačar went on to win the race by 9 minutes and 56 seconds, the largest winning margin at the Giro in 59 years.\n\n\"If I arrive at the Tour de France with these legs that I have now, I think it's going to be just fine,\" Pogačar said at the end of the Giro, ahead of taking a week off to \"enjoy some coffee rides and good cake\" before heading back to altitude.\n\nHe is backed by an extraordinary UAE Team Emirates squad, featuring a bevvy of stars all geared to assist him in the high mountains.\n\nRiders have come close to the double in the years since Pantani managed it — Chris Froome won the Giro then finished third at the Tour in 2018 for one.\n\nBritish rider Froome, incidentally, is the last rider to win two grand tours in the same year, when he won the Tour and the Vuelta in 2017.\n\nJonas Vingegaard Hansen capped a superb start to the season by winning one of sport's great impractical trophies. (Getty Images: Tim de Waele)\n\nVingegaard Hansen was having a brilliant start to 2024 before disaster struck in the Basque Country in March.\n\nThe two-time Tour champion won both stage races he completed, O Gran Camiño and Tirreno-Adriatico, including the mountain classification.\n\nBut then, on the slippery, dangerous roads of the Itzulia Basque Country, disaster struck.\n\nVingegaard Hansen, Roglič, Evenepoel and Australian Jay Vine all went down on the fourth stage from Etxarri Aranatz to Legutio, suffering an assortment of injuries.\n\nVingegaard Hansen broke his ribs, collarbone and punctured his lung in the incident that saw Vine fracture a cervical vertebra and suffer two additional fractures in his thoracic spine.\n\nThe Danish star has not raced since and, up until the Visma-Lease a Bike team was named, was no certainty to race at the Tour.\n\nThe situation is an intriguing reversal of the situation the pair faced last year when it was Pogačar who was injured leading into the France showdown after be broke his wrist at Liege-Bastogne-Liege.\n\nPogačar seemed to be OK until the 17th stage, when he dramatically imploded on the slopes of the Col de la Loze.\n\n\"I'm gone. I'm dead,\" he said over the team radio before limping home over five minutes behind Vingegaard Hansen.\n\nCan Vingegaard Hansen use his team to maintain the pressure on Pogačar? If he does he'll have to do it without chief lieutenant and Vuelta a España winner Sepp Kuss, who is out of the race with COVID.\n\n(By the way, if you're confused by the addition of Hansen to Vingegaard's name, don't be. Vingegaard, who was officially Vingegaard Rasmussen, officially took the last name of his wife, Trine Marie Hansen, last year, but will likely still be called Vingegaard as Danes typically drop their second family name.)\n\nMark Cavendish is back for one more shot at the overall Tour de France stage wins record. (Getty Images: Tim de Waele)\n\nAfter last year's crushing disappointment, when the Manx missile crashed out on the eighth stage of the Tour.\n\nThe bunch sprint specialist was aiming for a record 35th stage win at the race, bettering the record of 34 that he currently shares with Merckx.\n\nWhen he clambered into the back of an ambulance last year, it appeared that his quest would be over.\n\nHaving battled debilitating illnesses, loss of form and multiple crashes over a road career that has extended almost two decades, Cavendish appeared done.\n\nHowever, the now 39-year-old, newly knighted sprint star is back for one more attempt at the record.\n\nHe'll be up against a full cast of challengers, including four-time stage winner at last year's Tour Jasper Philipsen and the ultra-aggressive, take-no-prisoners approach from his Alpecin-Deceuninck team.\n\nExpect to see Jai Hindley leading the BORA-hansgrohe train a lot in this year's Tour de France. (Getty Images: Dario Belingheri)\n\nAustralia's best chance of success at this year's race may well be vicariously through their teammates.\n\nFormer Giro winner Jai Hindley will ride fully in support of Roglič at Bora-Hansgrohe, while Jack Haig will work for Santiago Buitrago at Team Bahrain Victorious.\n\nThe main focus for Australia's hopes will be at Team Jayco AlUla.\n\nDutch sprinter Dylan Groenewegen will be the main source of investment in stage wins, but one-time green jersey winner Michael Matthews will also likely be a factor in the tougher sprints.\n\nThe Tour de France will be available to watch on SBS from June 29.\n\nThe coverage will be available via the television channel and online through SBS On Demand.\n\nThe Tour starts in Florence, Italy on Saturday, July 29.\n\nCoverage of the race in Australia will start at 7:50pm (AEST) on SBS On Demand, with TV coverage starting at 8:30pm AEST.\n\nIt is the first of 21 stages, with the race concluding on July 21 with an individual time trial in Nice.\n\nIt's the first time the race will ever finish outside of Paris and the first time since 1989 when the race will finish with a time trial.\n\nThe last time the race did so, American Greg LeMond beat Frenchman Laurent Fignon by just eight seconds, the smallest winning margin in Tour de France history. \n\nThere is, but unlike last year, where the Tour de France Femmes followed on immediately after the men's race, this year the women will have to wait until after the Olympics.\n\nThat means the Tour de France Femmes will not start until August 12, getting underway in Rotterdam before finishing on Alpe d'Huez.\n\nTopic:NRL\n\nTopic:Paralympic Games\n\nTopic:Sport\n\nTopic:Police\n\nTopic:State of Origin\n\nTopic:Health\n\nAnalysis by Patricia Karvelas\n\nTopic:Foreign Aid\n\nTopic:Alternative Energy\n\nTopic:Courts\n\nAnalysis by Simon Smale\n\nTopic:Sport\n\nAnalysis by Simon Smale\n\nTopic:Road Cycle Racing\n\nCycle Sport\n\nFrance\n\nRoad Cycle Racing\n\nSport\n\nTopic:Health\n\nAnalysis by Patricia Karvelas\n\nTopic:Foreign Aid\n\nTopic:Alternative Energy\n\nTopic:Courts\n\nTopic:World War 2\n\nTopic:Children's Health\n\nTopic:Activism and Lobbying\n\nTopic:Indigenous Culture\n\nWe acknowledge Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples as the First Australians and Traditional Custodians of the lands where we live, learn, and work.\n\nThis service may include material from Agence France-Presse (AFP), APTN, Reuters, AAP, CNN and the BBC World Service which is copyright and cannot be reproduced.\n\nAEST = Australian Eastern Standard Time which is 10 hours ahead of GMT (Greenwich Mean Time)"

It has been the biggest mistake of my life.\"\n\nVan de Velde was convicted of raping a 12-year-old girl in Milton Keynes, a city outside London, in 2014. He was released in 2017 after serving one year in prison in the Netherlands.\n\nAccording to court testimony, he had flown from Amsterdam to the UK when he was 19 to meet his victim, a girl he knew was just 12. The court heard that he had gone to the home of the victim, with whom he had communicated on social media before arranging to visit while her mother was out, and had taken her virginity before flying back home.\n\nVan de Velde was later arrested, extradited to the UK, where he was tried, convicted and sentenced to four years in prison. He was transferred back to the Netherlands and resentenced under Dutch law.\n\nVan de Velde has been a polarizing figure in the sports community since his return to professional volleyball. The Dutch Volleyball Federation (Nevobo) has supported his inclusion in the Games this summer.\n\n\"We know Steven's history. Before he expressed his desire to return to beach volleyball, we spoke extensively with him, as well as with [the Dutch Sports Federation] and the international volleyball federation FIVB,\" said Michel Everaert, general director at Nevobo.\n\nThe Dutch Olympic Committee has stood by its decision to nominate Van de Velde for the national team, despite the backlash. The organization has maintained that the decision lies with the national volleyball federation, which has opted not to impose further sanctions on him.\n\n\"Van de Velde now meets all the qualification requirements for the Olympic Games and is therefore part of the team,\" the committee said.\n\nSince his release, van de Velde has been actively competing. He has participated in several notable tournaments, including Volleyball World Beach Pro Tour events. In 2023, van de Velde and Immers, his partner, secured a major victory at the Chiang Mai Challenge in Thailand, earning them a spot among the top 20 in the FIVB Beach Volleyball World Ranking.\n\nThis decision has been met with criticism from various groups and individuals, including child protection organizations. The National Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children (NSPCC) condemned the volleyball federation's decision, highlighting what they said was Van de Velde's lack of remorse and the potential message it sends about accountability and rehabilitation.\n\nNewsweek has reached out to the Dutch Volleyball Federation and the International Volleyball Federation for comment.\n\nNewsweek is committed to journalism that's factual and fair.\n\nHold us accountable and submit your rating of this article on the meter. \n\nNewsweek is committed to journalism that's factual and fair.\n\nHold us accountable and submit your rating of this article on the meter. \n\nJesus is a Newsweek reporter based in New York.

Garnbret, an eight-time world champion and defending Olympic gold medalist, attracted headlines last year when she spoke out on Instagram about the problems of eating disorders: “Do we want to raise the next generation of skeletons? Let’s not look away.” The 25-year-old Garnbret said she became concerned when she started hearing young girls “talking about how if they lost some weight, they would be just as good” as the other girls who were winning.

Garnbret called for more discussion about eating disorders at the youth level of the sport, and for more action by officials, including banning unhealthy athletes from competing. (Anthony Anex/Keystone via AP, File)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt wasn’t going to be a toe injury that would keep one of the world’s biggest stars in sport climbing from getting to the Paris Olympics.\n\nDefending champion Janja Garnbret kept practicing on one leg after her big toe “just broke” during a climb last year, grinding and training any way she could to get back in shape.\n\nThe eight-time world champion was able to recover from the rare injury and will be competing for a medal again in Paris.\n\nNo other athlete has won as many international climbing titles as Garnbret, who attracts just as many headlines for her dominance in the sport as she does for being an advocate for eradicating eating disorders from sport climbing.\n\n“Everything is going by the plan so far,” Garnbret told The Associated Press. “I’m not injured this year or anything like that. So it’s been good. It’s been going well. I’m really happy with my form and shape and how everything is evolving.”\n\nGarnbret hurt her foot during a routine climb in February 2023, when her left big toe suddenly broke. Doctors struggled to find out what was wrong at first, raising concerns about her future.\n\n“It was not easy. It was my first serious injury in my career,” the Slovenian climber said. “I didn’t know how to deal with it because I hadn’t experienced anything like this before. I had a lot of doubts and negative thoughts. I didn’t even know if I would get back to the same level I was before. It was not easy, but I could still train and climb, I still had the right foot and both hands, so I was climbing with one foot.”\n\nGarnbret had to adjust her training routine to stay in shape and keep her foot strong.\n\n\n\n\n“I never stopped training,” she said. “I just couldn’t do some things I would normally do, like slab climbing or like climbing longer routes. I couldn’t do that, but anything else I could do. Then I saw that I was getting stronger, so it didn’t bother me too much.”\n\nGarnbret said she worked so much on her injured left foot that it became stronger than the right one. She said she got tired more easily after the injury but hasn’t felt any pain, and she is confident that she will be able to peak in Paris. She was able to start her Olympic preparations in November as originally planned.\n\nHer results since returning from the injury have been promising, with a second place in boulder in the World Cup in Prague last June in her first competition since fracturing the toe. She won both the boulder and lead events at the World Cup in Innsbruck later that same month, and earned two gold medals at the world championships in Bern in August — in boulder and combined — as well as a silver in lead. She also won the home World Cup in Koper, Slovenia.\n\nVeteran world champion Petra Klingler said Garnbret has been “pushing the bar for the whole sport to another level.”\n\n“Mentally, she’s really, really strong,” the Swiss climber said. “But also, she’s a hard worker. I guess talent and being a hard worker, is a good combination. But I think also next to that, just like the team she built up over the years is what helps her a lot. So I think there are many, many things about her which are just exceptional and come together perfectly for being an amazing athlete.”\n\nThis season Garnbret won both World Cup events she participated, both in China, in lead and boulder.\n\n“I feel confident,” said the 25-year-old Garnbret, who has been outspoken about eating disorders in the sport and called for officials to “not look away” from the problem.\n\nIn 2021, Garnbret made history along with then-boyfriend Domen Skofic by climbing the highest chimney in Europe, which is in Slovenia, a feat that took more than seven hours.\n\nIn 2019, Garnbret also made headlines by becoming the first climber to win all six boulder World Cup events, and she had a winning streak that ended in 2021 after nine consecutive wins.\n\nHer career highlight came in Tokyo, when she triumphed in the Olympic debut for sport climbing. \n\nAll that matters now is whether she will be able to repeat as the gold medal winner in Paris to remain as the sports’ only female Olympic champion.\n\n___\n\nAP Summer Olympics: https://apnews.com/hub/2024-paris-olympic-games\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCopyright 2025 The Associated Press.

        "expanded content": "There was almost a sense of disbelief on Kiran Pahal’s face as her 400m timing flashed on the big screen at the Tau Lal Devi Stadium, Panchkula, where the Interstate Athletics Meet is underway.\n\nKiran’s reaction was fully justified. The Haryana athlete, competing in her first competition after a break of over a year, clocked a solid 50.92s – the second-best quarter-mile run ever by an Indian after Hima Das’s 50.79s.\n\n“I was nervous since I was competing after a long break but a good performance in the heats (52.33s) definitely eased my nerves a bit. I wasn’t really expecting to clock such a good time. It’s a surprise for me as well. But I am really happy to earn a spot for Paris,” said Kiran, whose previous best was 51.84s.\n\nKiran was head and shoulders above the rest, finishing almost three seconds ahead of Devyaniba Zala who finished second in her semifinal group. Her impressive performance comes with a backstory of injuries and personal battles.\n\n“I could not compete last year because there were some family issues,” said Kiran, her eyes moist. After taking a deep breath she continued: “After my father passed away about two years ago, my family hasn’t supported my sporting endeavours. It’s been six months since I have spoken to my mother. It’s not easy.”\n\nIf a strained relationship with family wasn’t difficult enough, constant injuries made life tougher for the 24-year-old runner. A hamstring injury ruined her bid to participate in the Federation Cup in May at Bhubaneswar.\n\n“Oh, don’t ask! The last year and a half I have gone through hell and come back. Injuries, family issues, financial struggles – it is a long list. I almost thought of quitting the sport but somehow managed to hang in,” says Kiran, a clerk with the Indian Railways.\n\nHer father’s demise was a huge setback for Kiran. He was her biggest fan and ensured all her training requirements were met. “He never let me feel that things were tough at home. After he passed away I got to know that he had taken loans from a lot of people to support me,” recalls Kiran.\n\nA certain track and field star played a major role in helping Kiran stay afloat during those turbulent times. National record holder Hima Das, who is going through a lean patch, not only gave Kiran the much-needed pep talk but also supported her with shoes and other dietary requirements.\n\n“I consider her like my elder sister. Hima didi has helped me a lot. I told her my situation and she didn’t hesitate even once. I’m so grateful to her,” says Kiran.\n\nNo trials for Kiran: Sumariwalla\n\nKiran’s long absence from competition and a big performance on return did raise a few eyebrows but it won’t affect her prospects. The Athletics Federation of India president Adille Sumariwalla said he wasn’t surprised by Kiran’s performance and confirmed her participation in the Olympics.\n\n“The rules and guideline marks are there on the website. If she has qualified she will go,” said Sumariwalla. Although Kiran is ready to run for the relay team in Paris, if required, it is unlikely that the federation will consider her since they have a strict campers-only policy.\n\nFor now, Kiran will focus on the finals where she will have the opportunity to break Hima’s national record. “I look up to her and I am unsure I can match her standards. I will not talk about records now. I only want to focus on the final race and then start preparations for Paris,” says Kiran, who trains with coach Akaash Chikara in Rohtak.\n\n\n\n\n\n"

Before he expressed his desire to return to beach volleyball at the time, we spoke extensively with him but also with NOC*NSF, among others,” said Michel Everaert, general director at Nevobo, in a statement. \n\nVan de Velde’s case was tried in the United Kingdom at Aylesbury crown court. \n\nThe prosecution made it clear that the victim, who remains anonymous, had been upfront with the volleyball star that she was seven years his junior.\n\nSandra Beck, the prosecuting lawyer on the case, said at the trial, “She describes that she had met Steven Van de Velde on Facebook, they spoke regularly through that and he made her feel special.” \n\nThree days before a warrant was issued for Van de Velde’s arrest in 2015, he was named the Dutch volleyball champion with his teammate Dirk Boehle – and would have been training at the time for the 2016 Olympic team, according to the Milton Keynes Citizen. \n\n“You may judge, of course. It was the biggest mistake of my life,” Van de Velde said in a sit-down video interview with Nevobo in 2018. “I can’t reverse it, I did what I did, so I have to carry the consequences.” \n\nThe NOC said in a statement to the media that the volleyballer was able to return to the sport in 2018 after “an intensive professionally supervised trajectory.” \n\n“Van de Velde now meets all the qualification requirements for the Olympic Games and is therefore part of the team,” it added.\n\nAt the time of his conviction, the judge said “You were the adult, she was the child, and until you recognize that, you will remain a danger to young girls.” \n\n“The emotional harm that has been caused to this child is enormous,” the jurist said. “As she matures, she will have to come to realize that you are not the nice man she thought you were and hoped you might be.”\n\nAfter Van de Velde’s sentencing in 2016, Nevobo’s Everaert said to the Milton Keynes citizen, “He could have made it all the way to the top.”\n\n\n\nAdvertisement"

If they can translate what they have been doing in training in the tournament, they can go far.”\n\nNova also feels that the lengthy period that Tang Jie-Ee Wei have had to train this year has been beneficial.\n\n“Tang Jie-Ee Wei had more time to train as they did not need to compete in the Thomas Cup Finals last month and Asia Team Championships (in February),” said Nova.\n\n“They also lost in the first round of the Indonesian Open earlier this month which was their last tournament before the Olympics, so they have been training since then.\n\n“I feel that their preparation has been the best so far, compared to the other departments.\n\n“Tang Jie especially, has been extraordinary in training. He rarely gets tired. Both he and Ee Wei can easily follow the programme we have given them and they never complain about anything,” added Nova.\n\nNova now wants Tang Jie-Ee Wei, who will be making their debuts in the Olympics, to bring out their best in Paris.\n\n“I told them to take it like it’s their last Olympics and not their first, and go all out,” said Nova.\n\n“Mental strength is very important in the Olympics and psychologist Frederick Tan has been working with them on this.\n\n“They have prepared well and it’s a waste if they don’t play their best.”\n\nFor the record, Chan Peng Soon-Goh Liu Ying were the only Malaysian mixed pair to ever win a medal in the Olympics when they captured silver in the 2016 Rio de Janeiro edition.\n\nThank you for your report!\n\nCopyright © 1995-\n            \n\n Star Media Group Berhad [197101000523 (10894-D)]\n\nBest viewed on Chrome browsers.\n\n\n\nWe would love to keep you posted on the latest promotion.

I’m not going to go into that in great detail because that’s between Korbin and I. But the conversations we have had have been to talk about the importance of what we have to be mindful of and how we’re all part of environment that’s one that appreciates and understands the damage that that can do.”\n\nAt the end of March, Albert shared posts on TikTok of a Christian sermon that described being gay and “feeling transgender” as wrong. \n\nThe 20-year-old rising soccer star deleted the posts and apologized calling it “insensitive and hurtful” and describing her actions as “immature and disrespectful.” \n\nAlbert had also reportedly liked a post on Instagram that mocked former USWNT star Megan Rapinoe’s injury in her final career game, with the post including the statement: “God taking time off performing miracles to make sure Megan Rapinoe sprains her ankle in her final ever game.”\n\nThe midfielder has been jeered at USWNT games in April and earlier this month, and Hayes said that Albert has heard the negative feedback at games. \n\n“I think she’s had a really, really tough time. She’s really struggled,” Hayes said Wednesday.\n\nThe USWNT coach also went on to defend Albert’s character. \n\n“I can say, firsthand, having spent a limited time with Korbin, she really is a lovely person and someone who really values the most important things,” Hayes said. “She’s spending time working on herself, as we all do. I look forward to building on that with her. I want everybody to know that my job is to make sure I keep doing that and I want the fans to really embrace Korbin. I do think she’s a tremendous human being.”\n\nAlbert has made 11 appearances — including the CONCACAF W Gold Cup — for the women’s national team after being called up in November.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement"

Similar to stealth aircraft that avoid detection by deflecting radar signals away from detectors, the fabric absorbs and prevents infrared light from reaching cameras and infrared sensors.\n\nSome devices have unintentionally demonstrated how the infrared sensing used in night vision goggles and thermal cameras can reveal the unseen, like the OnePlus 8 Pro’s “Photochrom” color filter that worked like X-ray vision on the thin shell of an Apple TV. When used on people, infrared photography can reveal the lines of a person’s body or the undergarments they’re wearing beneath a thin layer of clothing, such as those worn by athletes.\n\nIn 2020, athletes complained to the Japanese Olympic Committee after discovering infrared camera “photos of themselves shared on social media with sexually explicit captions,” according to The Japan Times. Since then, Mizuno, Sumitomo Metal Mining, and Kyodo Printing have co-developed the new fabric that’s stretchable enough to be used in athletic uniforms while also protecting athletes.\n\nIn experiments shared by Mizuno, a printed black “C” beneath a layer of “Game uniform fabric” and the new infrared-absorbing fabric is nearly entirely obscured when photographed with an infrared camera. Multiple layers of the new light-absorbing fabric would help more, but with athletes already expressing concerns about the extreme heat expected at the upcoming Paris Olympic Games, the uniforms need to strike a balance between protecting against invasive creeps while keeping participants cool and comfortable.\n\nA weekly newsletter by David Pierce designed to tell you everything you need to download, watch, read, listen to, and explore that fits in The Verge’s universe.\n\n© 2025 Vox Media, LLC.

All Rights Reserved.\n\nFILE - People film the Olympic rings that are displayed on the Eiffel Tower, June 7, 2024 in Paris. On Wednesday, 26, 2024, NBC announced plans to change the way they cover the 2024 Olympics. (AP Photo/Aurelien Morissard, File)\n\nNEW YORK (AP) — The days of “plausibly live” Olympics coverage on NBC are coming to an end.\n\nThe network displayed some of the new features it has planned for coverage of the Summer Olympics in Paris starting on July 26 — including personalized highlights packages generated by artificial intelligence with the voice of Al Michaels and a star turn by Steven Spielberg — but none could match the sea change in attitude toward how the Games are presented.\n\nFor years, NBC has zealously guarded its prime-time Olympics telecasts no matter the time zone, aggravating fans blocked from seeing key events if they happen earlier in the day live. Attempts to essentially pretend that the events were being seen live added to frustration.\n\nThis year, NBC said Wednesday that Mike Tirico will host two daily Olympics shows, one that coincides with prime-time in Paris (2 to 5 p.m. Eastern in the United States) and featuring live competition in marquee sports like swimming, gymnastics and track & field. The other, during prime-time hours in the United States while Paris sleeps, will be a curated view of the day’s best action.\n\nMeanwhile, the network promised that its affiliated Peacock streaming service would show every Olympic competition live.\n\n“We’ve given the audience choice, which I think the consumer wants,” said Molly Solomon, NBC Olympics executive producer. “We know how popular live sports is, so to hold something back doesn’t make any sense in this new media landscape.”\n\nThat means reconfiguring how NBC structures its telecast for prime-time in the United States, always the biggest draw for viewers. NBC won’t just show competitions, but will use the extra time to tell viewers more about why things played out the way they did, and give a backstage view, she said.\n\nProducers are aware that many viewers come to those delayed broadcasts already knowing who won some of the events, while others won’t and will want to be surprised.\n\n“We never want to ruin the suspense,” Solomon said. “But it is a tightrope act.”\n\nMore heavily than in the past, NBC will lean into personality profiles of athletes and feature celebrities in the coverage; Snoop Dogg, for example, is coming to Paris on NBC’s dime. Solomon said she might make use of features that are being planned for Peacock, such as a highlights package narrated by Kevin Hart and Kenan Thompson.\n\n“It’s going to look very different from the prime-time shows that you’ve seen in the past,” she said.\n\nThat will also require some business adjustments, with NBC selling advertising packages that include inventory in both “prime-time” broadcasts, said Mark Lazarus, chairman of the NBC Universal Media Group. The network is also preparing to emphasize viewership counts across all of its platform, in a way that deflects attention from likely ratings decreases in the evening compared to past years.\n\nLazarus also acknowledged that NBC did a poor job with its Olympics offerings on Peacock four years ago, essentially overpromising and underdelivering, and consumers reacted with “the big digital middle finger.”\n\nHe promised dramatic improvement for Peacock this summer.\n\nThe streamer is also using AI to allow fans to create personalized highlights packages, by picking in advance some favorite sports and the type of action they would like to see. AI will then deliver those specific highlights, narrated by an AI-generated model of Michaels’ voice — eerily realistic during a demonstration given on Wednesday.\n\nNBC estimates it will create some 7 million variations of highlight packages through the new service.\n\nBesides Snoop Dogg, NBC is bringing in celebrities like Kelly Clarkson, Peyton Manning and Jimmy Fallon for its coverage. It announced Wednesday that “Saturday Night Live” actor Colin Jost will help cover surfing from Tahiti. And to emphasize storytelling — NBC is billing the Olympics as a reality show, comedy and drama all in one — Spielberg will narrate “Land of Stories,” a short film that will run before the Olympics opening ceremonies.\n\n___\n\nDavid Bauder writes about media for The Associated Press.

However, he won’t be running his premier event, the one he’s the Olympic champion in; instead, he will focus on earning his spot in Paris in the 100m, which means he could risk missing selection for the 200m.\n\nDe Grasse’s reasoning for not competing in the 200m is to concentrate on improving his speed mechanics and his start in the 100m event. “I want to focus on the 100 and improve my start,” says De Grasse. “Coach wants me to get that speed back. I know it will translate to the 200m.”\n\nAndre De Grasse has arrived in Montreal for 🇨🇦 @paris2024 Trials.\n\nHe healthy, wants sub 10 and the Canadian 100m title. But it won’t be easy with with 6-7 🇨🇦 sprinters vying for only three spots.\n\nHe will also not be in the 200m: “I want to focus on 100m and improve my start.” pic.twitter.com/uGDRFiuONi\n\n— Canadian Running (@CanadianRunning) June 26, 2024\n\n\n\nThe risk De Grasse faces is not receiving an automatic spot from Athletics Canada for competing in the event at nationals. Three Canadian men currently hold the men’s 200m Olympic standard, alongside De Grasse: Aaron Brown and Brendon Rodney, both of whom will be competing in the men’s 200m at Trials on Saturday and Sunday. Both men will likely secure their tickets to Paris, especially with a win. However, things could get complicated if Jerome Blake, who sits next in the rankings, runs the Olympic standard of 20.16 seconds and wins, potentially leaving De Grasse on the outside looking in.\n\nAccording to Section 12 of Athletics Canada’s Paris 2024 qualification criteria: “Athletes must compete at a Canadian Championships (CC) or Trials in the event for which they are seeking nomination.” However, De Grasse has received a coaches’ exemption for the men’s 200m event. This means he will not earn an automatic berth to the Olympics at Canadian Trials and will leave his fate in the hands of the Athletics Canada selection committee on July 2nd.\n\nDe Grasse met the Olympic 200m standard last September at the Diamond League final in Eugene, Ore., with the fourth-fastest time of his career–19.76 seconds. He has yet to dip under the 20-second mark in 2024, with his best time being 20.09 seconds clocked in Ostrava, Czech Republic, in late May.\n\nBlake, a training partner of De Grasse’s under acclaimed sprint coach Rana Reider, has yet to contest the 200m distance this season. But a win and a near-personal best performance could put him in selection contention, forcing the Athletics Canada selection committee to make a difficult decision.\n\nThe 29-year-old De Grasse is arriving in Montreal in the best shape he’s been in since 2021. “I’m starting to get my speed back,” says De Grasse. “I’m feeling like my old self again. I’m healthy, and that’s the main thing. There are six or seven guys running 10.0 seconds now; it used to be just three.”\n\nYou can catch De Grasse competing in the 100m semi-finals at the 2024 Bell Canadian Olympic Trials from Montreal live on Runnerspace or AthleticsCanada.tv on Friday, June 28 at 6:55 p.m. ET; the final is scheduled for 8:30 p.m. Friday evening (subscription required).\n\nGet the digital edition of Running for your chosen platform:\n\n\n\n Apple News+\n\n\n Zinio\n\n\n\nPressReader\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

The highlights can also be further customized to focus on things like viral moments, athlete backstories, or other categories, with each package running about 10 minutes.\n\n\n\tAn NBCUniversal executive says that there are 7 million possible ways that the playlists could be customized.\n\n\n\tMichaels, as one would expect, approved the use of his voice, which was trained on his years of work for the broadcaster. \n\n\n\t“When I was approached about this, I was skeptical but obviously curious,” Michaels said. “Then I saw a demonstration detailing what they had in mind. I said, ‘I’m in.’”\n\n\n\tMichaels has worked on NBC’s Olympics coverage since 2010 (back when he was at ABC, he called the legendary “Miracle on Ice” game), and also was the lead play-by-play announcer for NBC Sunday Night Football. Michaels currently works in the booth for Amazon’s Thursday Night Football.\n\n\n\tNotably, an NBCU executive says that a team of NBC Sports editors will review all of the content before it is able to be added to the recaps “for quality, validation and accuracy,” including the pronunciation and intonation of certain names or events.\n\n\n\tThat addresses one of the big concerns around generative AI, namely around accuracy and context. Having humans check the system before generating the recaps adds a layer of protection.\n\n\n\tStill, the artificial intelligence Al Michaels is a major move into generative artificial intelligence from a major media company, one that may provide a template for future offerings, where talent is looped in and (presumably) compensated for their work.\n\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t“Peacock continues to introduce unique customer-first features that strengthen our unmatched leadership in live streaming,” said Kelly Campbell, president of Peacock and direct-to-consumer, NBCUniversal. “With these recaps alongside interactive elements like Peacock Live Actions and Discovery Multiview, we’re bringing the best of sports together with the best of technology to deliver fans a personalized Olympics experience in a way that’s never been possible before.”\n\nSign up for THR news straight to your inbox every day\n\nSign up for THR news straight to your inbox every day\n\nSubscribe for full access to The Hollywood Reporter\n\nSend us a tip using our anonymous form."

Mikel Arteta's priority remains strengthening in midfield, football.london understands, though unique market opportunities could alter plans with a new attacker possibly being signed.\n\nBecause of financial concerns, it is unlikely that any marquee deals are sanctioned over the coming months. Instead, it appears Arteta wants to raise the floor of his squad as opposed to elevating the ceiling with his most recent transfer comments hinting at exactly that.\n\n“[We] look again,” Arteta told CNN when asked about transfers. “All the margins, squad-wise, the process that we have at the football club, our methodology, especially on how we can make our players better, more competitive, more consistent and cause them to raise the level and be better than the previous season\n\n“I think our focus has to be with what we have already in house. How can we be better? There are margins and there are players that can still develop and be better and that’s the objective that we have.\" Despite that, Arsenal have been linked to several players in a number of different positions.\n\nAs for the goalkeeping department, with Aaron Ramsdale possibly moving on, Arsenal could be targeting a new shot-stopper. Feyenoord's Justin Bijlow has already been mooted as an option with Espanyol's Garcia, currently valued at €25million (£21.2m), another name linked with Spanish journalist Gerard Romero going as far as saying he will soon be an Arsenal player.\n\nWith that in mind, football.london has taken a look at Garcia's career thus far, the latest on his future and what he could bring to Arsenal.\n\nREAD MORE: Arteta signs, striker gem and multiple deals – Arsenal's three biggest transfer jobs this summer \n\n READ MORE: Arsenal transfer news live - Guirassy 'done deal' amid Amadou Onana decision and Eze truth\n\nHaving spent the bulk of his youth career at CF Damm and CE Manresa, he later joined Espanyol in 2016. After spending three years in the academy setup, Garcia made his senior debut with the reserves in late 2019, while his full senior debut arrived just over two years later in the Copa del Rey.\n\nHis first La Liga appearance came in January 2022 though he mostly spent the remainder of that season and the following one on the bench. Only in March of this year did his first-team breakthrough arrive where he kept a clean sheet against SD Huesca in Spain's second division.\n\nThe 23-year-old then played out the remainder of the season with a further seven clean sheets to his name from 13 games, helping his side finish fourth. As a result of their final league standing, Espanyol achieved promotion through the play-offs following a 2-1 aggregate win over Real Oviedo.\n\nGiven his impressive performances on the way to helping Espanyol seal promotion, transfer interest was inevitable with Real Madrid and Liverpool already being linked to the goalkeeper.\n\nHowever, judging by his comments, he is focused on the upcoming campaign with Espanyol. “I have always felt the love of the fans,” Garcia said recently. “Very happy that people are with me.\n\n“And for that part (transfers), don’t worry, I’m very good here and above all I would ask you to be calm and encourage us.” Any potential deal would also be complicated by the fact Garcia is in Spain's 2024 Olympics squad with the games not finishing until August 11.\n\nFollowing his first appearance of the 2023/24 season, Garcia maintained an 82.5 per cent save percentage, as per FB ref. Standing at 6ft3ins, he also managed to claim an impressive 2.14 crosses per 90 minutes with a 16.1 per cent cross prevention rate compared to David Raya’s 13 per cent. \n\nAs he only played half of a season, with 21 appearances in total, Garcia conceded just eight goals while Raya let in 31 from a total of 41 games in all competitions. In terms of clean sheets, with Raya winning the golden glove, he kept 16 Premier League clean sheets and four in the Champions League.\n\nMeanwhile in Spain, Garcia ensured 12 of Espanyol's opponents, from his 21 games played, did not score.\n\n"

The Interstate Athletics Meet, which kicks off on Wednesday in Panchkula, Haryana, will be the last major competition for athletes to attempt to make the cut for the mega event before the qualification cycle closes at the end of this month.\n\nAs things stand, 18 athletes have achieved the direct qualification marks from various events including the relay and race walk and 16 will finally board the flight to Paris. The tally is expected to reach at least 31 considering the current ranking placement.This Interstate meet, being a B-level tournament, gives an opportunity for those on the fence to accumulate some valuable ranking points before this month’s deadline.\n\nAmong those who are expected to go full throttle at Panchkula are the 4x400m mixed relay team who are chasing 3:11.88s to replace Kenya at the 16th spot and qualify for the Games. To meet the World Athletics norms for ranking points the Athletics Federation of India has invited two international teams – Maldives and Sri Lanka – to participate in the relays. But the move is unlikely to boost the Indian team’s chances of qualifying since both the international teams are slower compared to India.\n\n“You saw what happened at the Asian Championships, no? We were faster than these teams and while I was running I just took a huge lead and had no clue where the rest were. That is not an ideal scenario when you are chasing a qualification mark. You need teams that push you,” said Amoj Jaacob, who will have to pull out an extraordinary run if the mixed team stands a chance to qualify.\n\nBut we can’t say that it is impossible,” said Jacob, who has a personal best of 45.68s. The chances of the mixed relay team qualifying for Paris seem bleak, Jacob feels that PBs might help the relay team make it. “We are still in it. If I and Anas bhai run a sub-45s race and the rest pull out their personal bests we might still make it,” said the spirited runner.\n\nAFI president Adille Sumariwalla felt that the mixed relay team had a chance and said, “Personally, I feel that the mixed 4x400m relay will be the next big thing after the men’s 4x400m relay, though many people may not agree with this.”\n\nHigh jumpers Sarvesh Kushare (29) and Tejaswin Shankar (38), long jumper Jeswin Aldrin (32) – who has had a lukewarm season, triple jumpers Abdulla Aboobacker (21) and Praveen Chitravel (24), shot putters Abha Khatua (25) and Tajinderpal Singh Toor (25), javelin throwers Annu Rani (19) and Manu DP (15), and Jyothi Yarraji (31) are those in reckoning for Paris.\n\nThe AFI has maintained that all athletes will have to compete in the Interstate Meet for qualification and selection for Pairs barring reigning Olympic and World Champion Neeraj Chopra and a few race walkers who have already achieved qualification for Paris.\n\nAmong those to watch out at the event is long-distance runner Gulveer Singh, who is currently ranked 57. Guvleer’s coach Bahadur Singh reckons his ward needs to run below 13 minutes 27 seconds to finish within the 42 ranking bracket and qualify for the Olympics. The UP athlete, who has a personal best of 13:18.92s (national record), broke the 10,000m national mark in the season opener. Earlier this month, he took Avinash Sable’s spot in the national record books in 5000m.\n\n“If he runs well he can qualify. But yes he is in good form and we are very confident of him qualifying for Paris in the 5000m,” said coach Bahadur.\n\n\n\n\n\n"

(Getty Images: Christian Petersen)\n\nAthing Mu got tangled up in the middle of the track and started falling. One hand hit the ground, then the other. As she rolled onto her back, her bright pink shoes started pointing toward the sky.\n\nWith that, one of America's most promising runners saw her hopes of back-to-back Olympic titles in the 800m go down the drain, while sports fans got a refresher on just how unforgiving these US track trials really are.\n\nThe 22-year-old from New Jersey became the first big-name casualty of the trials Monday, victimised by a bunched-up pack in the backstretch of the first lap, to say nothing of the long-standing rule in the US that only the top three finishers at trials make the Olympics, regardless of their resume.\n\n\"I've coached it, I've preached it, I've watched it,\" Mu's coach, Bobby Kersee, told The Associated Press. \n\n\"And here's another indication that regardless of how good we are, we can leave some better athletes home than other countries have. It's part of our American way.\"\n\nMu filed an appeal and USA Track and Field officials sorted through the replays deep into the night, but eventually denied the protest. Kersee said Mu got spiked, had track burns and hurt her ankle.\n\n\"She's going to be licking her wounds for a couple of days,\" Kersee said.\n\nMu got back to her feet and finished, but was more than 22 seconds behind the winner, Nia Akins, who ran 1 minute, 57.36 seconds. Mu was choking back tears as she headed quickly off the track and through the tunnel after the race. She did not do interviews.\n\nShe was racing on the outside in a tightly bunched pack and looked to be veering to her left toward the eventual third-place finisher, Juliette Whitaker, when she tripped and went tumbling, leaving three runners behind her flailing as they jumped over and around her.\n\nABC Sport is live blogging every day of the Paris Olympics\n\nMu is hardly the first athlete to have this happen. One of the more memorable and heartbreaking moments on this track came eight years ago in the same event, when Alysia Montano, looking to return to the Olympics, got tripped up in the home stretch and stayed down on the track crying.\n\n\"I have a little mama bear feeling,\" said Montano, who is at the track this week doing in-house interviews over the PA system. \"But the race is brutal sometimes. It's two laps, a tight race and everyone's feeling scrappy to try to figure out what position they want to get into.\"\n\nThe Olympic trials marked Mu's first meet of the year after dealing with injuries all season. She looked to be in good form in her first two rounds, and Kersee said her season was coming together.\n\nUS star Athing Mu won the gold medal in the women's 800m at the Tokyo Olympics three years ago. (Getty Images: Tim Clayton)\n\nBut in the 800 final, she barely made it half a lap.\n\nDespite the fall, Mu could still go to Paris as part of the US relay pool; she was a key part of the team's gold-medal win in the 4x400 three years ago in Tokyo.\n\nAfter winning NCAA, national, world and Olympic championships all before turning 21, Mu won a bronze medal at the worlds last year and, afterward, conceded she needed a break from all the pressure, social media and other demands that came along with being tagged as one of track's great new stars.\n\nIn interviews leading into this week's meet in Eugene, she said she had rediscovered her love for the sport and was looking forward to the quest to become a back-to-back champion.\n\nShe has dominated this distance thanks, in part, to a long, loping stride, and that might be what cost her in a race where she came in as the favourite.\n\n\"I heard it and I was just like 'OK, keep running, it wasn't you,'\" second-place finisher Allie Wilson said of the commotion that resulted in Mu's tumble. \n\n\"That, unfortunately, is part of racing.

His 918 points rank him seventh all-time in Red Wings history and his 314 goals rank him eighth.\n\nNicknamed the “Magic Man”, Datsyuk was one of the most skilled players in his generation on both ends of the ice, winning the Selke Trophy three times (2008-10) and the Lady Byng Trophy four times (2006-09).\n\nHe was also named to the NHL’s top 100 players in 2017 as part of the league’s centennial season.\n\nDatsyuk played the last five seasons of his hockey career with SKA Saint Petersburg and the Yekaterinburg Automobilist in the KHL and won Gagarin Cup in 2017.\n\nThe Sverdlovsk, Russia, native represented his country five times at the Winter Olympic Games, taking home a gold medal in 2018 and a bronze medal in 2022.

The Minnesota product won three IIHF World Championships and medalled three times at Olympic Games.\n\nFor her career, Darwitz had 43 goals and 40 assists in 55 games at Olympics and worlds.

There were so many inspiring moments but five stand out as my favorites for us to remember for four years until the Los Angeles U.S. Trials leading up to the 2028 games.\n\nThe facial expression of Kate Douglass after breaking a meet record in the prelims of the 200-meter breaststroke. A surprised and exhilarated look on her face, a swimmer going so fast, taking her talents to another level, dazzling all of us with her rarified talent.\n\nAfter finishing third in the 100-meter freestyle – barely getting out-touched – Caeleb Dressel smiling and congratulating Jack Alexy who finished ahead of him and by doing so qualified for his first Olympics.

It’s rare for swimmers to qualify for any Olympic team given all the competitors vying for spots which makes Simone’s three-time achievement remarkable. The tear on her cheek told the story of hard work, deep emotion, and reaching a goal – again. Climbing back to the mountaintop repeatedly.\n\nCarson Foster, who made the team in the 400-meter individual medley, talking at a press conference about his brother, Jake, who competed last week but did not make the Olympic team.

A week of wonder and wishing, of not making it, being disappointed, and touching greatness, feeling like you did what you doubted you could do.\n\nIt will get more emotional later this summer at the Paris Games. The American athletes who made the team – every one of them a long shot in the sense of how hard it is to place first or second in their events – are American heroes for the rest of their lives.\n\nThey are Olympians and we salute them.\n\nAbout Charles Hartley\n\nCharles Hartley is a freelance writer based in Davidson, NC. He has a masters degree in journalism and a masters degree in business administration.\n\n\n\nΔ\n\n\n\nΔ\n\nRegan Smith breaking WR while winning 3 golds…. not sure how that was overlooked 🤦🏻‍♀️🧐\n\nPersonal fav was watching everyone else realize how good Luke Whitlock is for being just 2 months past turning 18. USA men’s distance free is in good hands when Finke decides he’s done.\n\nKatie Grimes final-ing in the 200 back was pretty neat.\n\nHonorable mention: Magic Man doing magic after slipping at the start in the semi’s 100B.\n\nIt’s maybe a stretch to judge from afar but to me, this Team USA seems like really nice group\n\nCasas. That was the best moment.\n\nHear, hear!\n\nHard to narrow it down to 5, but some of mine:\n\n-Shaine’s reaction after the 2IM and Carson’s sportsmanship in immediately, with zero lag time, swimming over to hug him\n-Matt Fallon’s AR and awesome celebration (although as a Penn alum I’m heavily biased) and also Matheny’s relief after barely missing the 100\n-David Johnston gritting out the 1500 at the end of an awful meet and making the team\n-Gretchen’s 100 fly semi (duh)\n-Regan’s 100 back (duh)\n-Anything Gabrielle Rose\n-Emma Weber’s reaction to her surprise qualification\n-Phoebe Bacon’s reaction and her team’s reaction to her 200 back (even though I was gutted for Curzan)\n-Beisel’s violin solo\n\nCouldn’t agree more about Jake Foster.We hope he does great things!\n\nMore from SwimSwam ContributorsSee All\n\nSubscribe to our newsletter and receive our latest updates!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSubscribe to SwimSwam Magazine!\n\n\nSubscribe\n\n\n© 2025 Swim Swam Partners, LLC.

Schmidt\n\nJenny Vrentas reported from Washington.\n\nFaced with demands from two decorated Olympic swimmers, members of Congress expressed an openness on Tuesday to withholding funding from the global regulator assigned to ensure an even Olympic playing field over its refusal to hold accountable Chinese swimmers who tested positive for a banned drug.\n\nIn testimony to a House subcommittee, Michael Phelps, the 23-time Olympic gold medalist, and Allison Schmitt, a four-time Olympic gold medalist, said it was unacceptable that the World Anti-Doping Agency, or WADA, had paved the way for the swimmers to win medals at the 2021 Games and compete at the coming ones in Paris.\n\nPhelps and Schmitt, who were joined in their testimony by the top antidoping official in the United States, said WADA’s inaction sent a message to professional athletes, amateurs and children that doping would be tolerated. Phelps said that such a lack of enforcement could ultimately doom the Olympics.\n\n“Honestly, if we continue to let this slide any farther, the Olympic Games might not even be there,” Phelps said during the hearing in front of the House Energy and Commerce Committee’s Oversight and Investigations Subcommittee.\n\nThe message from the two swimmers fell on receptive ears, with lawmakers from both parties suggesting that WADA could be at risk of losing its funding from the United States, which gives it more money than any other nation.\n\n“Perhaps if they are not going to do the job, we shouldn’t even fund them,” said Representative Morgan Griffith, a Virginia Republican and the chairman of the subcommittee.\n\nWe are having trouble retrieving the article content.\n\nPlease enable JavaScript in your browser settings.\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.

Road cyclists were chosen based on their global performances and adaptability to the Olympic course.\n\nIsabella Holmgren, 19, is the youngest cyclist on the Paris 2024 Canadian Olympic Team. She’s a two-time world junior champion in mountain bike and cyclocross, and this year, she’s already earned two UCI U23 World Cup gold medals in mountain biking. Joining her is her brother Gunnar Holmgren, who secured his spot for Paris 2024 with an eighth-place finish at the UCI Elite World Cup in May, where he became Team Canada’s first gold medallist at the Santiago 2023 Pan American Games.\n\nPodcast: How one sensational weekend changed the Olympic hopes of two Holmgren siblings\n\n\n\n“I’m very proud to soon become an Olympian, and being selected alongside my sister makes it even more special,” Holmgren said. “I’m building to my peak form over the next six weeks and I’m excited to get out there and honor the maple leaf.”\n\nMichael Woods, 37, is getting ready for his third Olympics at Paris 2024. He earned a historic bronze at the 2018 UCI World Championships and secured Canada’s second-best Olympic result in the road race at Tokyo 2020. Woods also won his first Tour de France stage in 2023. Joining him is former track cyclist Derek Gee, noted for his breakaways and recent stage win at le Critérium du Dauphiné. Gee’s performances at the 2023 Giro d’Italia earned him the combativity award, and he contributed to Canada’s fifth-place finish in Tokyo’s men’s team pursuit.\n\n“I’m unbelievably excited to represent Canada for my second Olympic Games in Paris this summer,” Gee said. “Tokyo 2020 was an experience of a lifetime and was a real privilege to race with the maple leaf on my back on the world’s biggest stage. Having spent some time in France already this year and seeing the build up, I can’t wait to experience the atmosphere in Paris this summer. I think it’s truly going to be unparalleled, especially at the cycling events.”\n\nAlison Jackson, known for her 2023 Paris-Roubaix victory, returns for her second Olympics after Tokyo 2020. She won a stage of the 2024 Vuelta España Femenina. Joining her is Olivia Baril, making her Olympic debut, a silver medallist in both the road race and time trial at the 2023 Canadian championships and podium finisher in a 2024 Vuelta España Femenina stage. Baril recently took the 2024 Canadian road championship title on Sunday.\n\nOne notable exception to the Games was triathlete Paula Findlay. There were only two road spots available for women in Paris, with one of those doing the time trial. Findlay has won the Canadian national time trial championships for the past three years, but has limited road racing experience.\n\nAlthough another triathlete Taylor Knibb,  won the USA national time trial championship in May guaranteed her a spot on the American Olympic team, that won’t be the case for Findlay\n\n“Every country obviously has their own criteria, and I think Taylor Knibb is a medal hopeful for the TT for the USA,” Findlay said to Triathlon Magazine. “I don’t think I’m quite at that level, but the criteria for Canada was they’re going to focus a little more on the road team. It was loosely in the back of my mind to give it a go, but I would have had to really commit to racing on the road.”\n\nThe Olympics begin July 26, right after the Tour de France concludes.\n\n \n\n \n\nGet the digital edition of Canadian Cycling Magazine\n\n\n\n \n  \n\n\nΔ"

I played with my heart and gave my all in yesterday’s match and unfortunately, due to a medial meniscus tear in my right knee, my team and I had to make a tough decision after careful consideration and consultation,” posted Djokovic.\n\nBefore making any moves regarding Wimbledon, Djokovic already made himself available for the upcoming Olympics to be held in Paris, France.\n\nIt was the Serbian Olympic Committee who announced that Djokovic will be officially part of the team that will compete in Paris.\n\n“But I’m going to take it day by day and then make a decision based on, of course, the feeling or the observation or the conclusion that I and team members have made over the next four, five, six days. If I know that I can play close to my maximum, or at maximum, then I’ll play.

(AP Photo/David Zalubowski, File)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCLEVELAND (AP) — Just days ahead of the NBA draft, the Cavaliers picked their coach.\n\nKenny Atkinson, an assistant with Golden State who helped Brooklyn rebuild before a puzzling departure, will be Cleveland’s new coach, a person familiar with decision told The Associated Press on Monday.\n\nThe Cavs have been looking for a new leader for their young team since firing J.B. Bickerstaff last month despite two straight playoff appearances and continued progress.\n\nThe sides have agreed on a deal and are working through details of Atkinson’s contract, said the person, who spoke on condition of anonymity because the team is not discussing its search publicly.\n\nESPN.com was first to report Atkinson is heading to Cleveland.\n\nIt’s possible there could be a minor delay in the Cavs officially announcing Atkinson’s hire. He joined the French national team’s staff as an assistant to coach Vincent Collet late last year and is currently in Paris preparing for the Olympics.\n\nAtkinson spent the past three seasons as Steven Kerr’s top assistant with the Warriors. In 2022, Atkinson accepted Charlotte’s coaching job but backed out a week after agreeing to a four-year contract.\n\nAtkinson’s hiring ends an expansive search by the Cavs’ front office. Atkinson was one of at least six known candidates to interview with the team since Bickerstaff’s firing on May 23 — a week after Cleveland was eliminated from the playoffs in five games by the eventual champion Boston Celtics.\n\n\n\n\nThe 57-year-old Atkinson checked all the boxes in what the Cavs were looking for: head coaching experience, offensive-minded and a strong reputation for player development.\n\nHe emerged as the choice by Cleveland vice president of basketball operations Koby Altman and general manager Mike Gansey last week. Atkinson then met with team chairman Dan Gilbert, who signed off on the Cavs’ first coaching hire in five years.\n\nAtkinson went 118-190 in his three-plus seasons with the Nets, overseeing their rise from the lower tier of the Eastern Conference to a playoff berth in 2019. It appeared he might be with Brooklyn for an extended period following the additions of superstars Kevin Durant and Kyrie Irving, but had a surprising split from the franchise in 2020.\n\nAtkinson’s parting was a major surprise given the team’s growth under his guidance. After leaving, he spent one season on the Los Angeles Clippers’ staff before going to Golden State.\n\nWith the Warriors, Atkinson got to see one of the league’s best offensive players in Stephen Curry and immersed himself in a dynamic offense system he’s certain to borrow from with Cleveland.\n\nOne of the knocks on Bickerstaff was his inability to improve Cleveland’s offense. Still, he went 170-159 in the regular season while guiding the Cavs back to relevance through a rebuild that began in 2018 when LeBron James left as a free agent.\n\nBickerstaff, who replaced John Beilein midway through the 2019-20 season, kept Cleveland among the top teams in the East this season despite a slew of injuries and Cleveland advanced beyond the first round of the playoffs without James on its roster for the first time since 1994.\n\nAtkinson, who got his NBA coaching start as an assistant on Mike D’Antoni’s staff with the New York Knicks in 2008, has some connections on the Cavs after working with center Jarrett Allen and forward Caris LeVert while in Brooklyn.\n\nHiring a new coach was the first priority in a pivotal summer for the Cavs. Next is getting All-Star guard Donovan Mitchell to accept a long-term contract extension, this week’s draft (Cleveland has the No. 20 overall pick) and perhaps retooling the roster with trades and in free agency.\n\nAfter the Cavs were knocked out of the playoffs, Altman said the team needed a coach who could bring new ideas and a fresh approach to get the most from the team’s core of players — Mitchell, Allen, guard Darius Garland and forward Evan Mobley.\n\nAtkinson will get the next shot.\n\n___\n\nAP NBA: https://apnews.com/hub/nba\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCopyright 2025 The Associated Press.

(AFL Players' Association)\n\nOn a mild spring day in 1977, two teams of professional athletes played the first recorded game of State of Origin football.\n\nHowever, it wasn't between the Maroons or Blues, and the game played wasn't even rugby league.\n\nWestern Australia hosted a Victorian representative side at Subiaco Oval in 1977, giving Australian Rules Football the unique and oft-forgotten bragging right of creating State of Origin footy.\n\nThe game burgeoned in popularity throughout the 80s and early 90s.\n\nBack then, it was everything in Aussie rules football.\n\n\"To play for Victoria in that era was undoubtedly one of the greatest achievements,\" AFL premiership coach Paul Roos said.\n\nSouth Australia and Victoria clashed in some close and heated contests in the State of Origin. (Port Adelaide Football Club.)\n\nThe AFL hosted its last official State Of Origin match 25 years ago as interest declined and the league pivoted towards being a national competition.\n\nIn the decades since, the NRL has made the format well and truly its own.\n\nSo much so that Game II of the men's series between NSW and Queensland will be held at the MCG this week in front of a crowd that's likely to be bigger than any AFL match this weekend.\n\nDespite being a former Victorian captain in Origin and an ardent fan, Paul Roos doesn't think the series should return to AFL calendars.\n\n\"We don't need it now,\" Roos told ABC AFL Daily.\n\n\"We have State of Origin every week: Adelaide Crows and Port Power, West Coast Eagles against Fremantle Dockers, so we get it every week — a couple of times a weekend.\"\n\nThe first State of Origin match in 1977 between Victoria and Western Australia was a rollercoaster.\n\nA VFL representative side smashed WA by 63 points in June that year, however, the inclusion of a number of West Australian players in the VFL side rankled some pundits.\n\nThree months later, Western Australia recorded a 94-point victory over Victoria — a turnaround of some 157 points, after some prominent \"sandgropers\" were given the chance to represent their state — not league — of origin.\n\nIt was this clash between states, understood to be the brainchild of Subiaco's Leon Larkin, that brought State Of Origin sport to Australia.\n\nThe format will always have its backers.\n\nEvery year when rugby league's State of Origin carnival rolls around, Australian rules pundits are quick to point out the format actually originated in the Aussie Rules.\n\nMelbourne's Hall of Fame midfielder Gary Lyon told Melbourne radio it was an \"unmitigated disgrace\" the State of Origin format had vanished from the AFL calendar.\n\nGary Lyon (seated) was part of Victoria's 1995 State of Origin side that also included Gary Ablett Sr, Jim Stynes and Robert Harvey. (Getty Images)\n\nFormer Collingwood president Eddie McGuire told Channel Nine he adored the series — with one small caveat.\n\n\"I loved it until I became president and you panic about players getting hurt,\" Maguire qualified.\n\n\"Do it before the season starts, once every three years, and do it as a carnival in, say, Tasmania, to continue that flavour.\"\n\nRodney Eade also captained his state in his playing days and loved every second of it.\n\nA composite photo of Victoria State of Origin player Garry Hocking, South Australian coach Graham Cornes and SA player Chris McDermott. (Getty Images)\n\nBut the proud Tasmanian's not convinced it could ever return.\n\nEade said clubs were unlikely to risk injuring their star players — even in a pre- or post-season format.\n\n\"Maybe they'll have a one-off [game] here or there because it's a fillip for players to be able to represent their state and have a state jumper.\n\n\"I think it'd be good in concept but how it comes about? Not too sure.\"\n\nPerhaps one of the league's most enduring memories occurred before a ball was even bounced.\n\nThe vision of EJ Whitten waving to the MCG crowd from the back of a convertible before a State of Origin match in 1995, tenderly resting his head against his son's face as the pair bathed in the crowd's adoration, is seared into the hearts of football lovers at the time.\n\nWhitten Sr would die of prostate cancer just two months later.\n\nEJ \"Ted\" Whitten acknowledges the crowd at his farewell parade before the State of Origin match between Victoria and South Australia at the MCG in 1995. (Getty Images)\n\nAccording to the record books, the last official State of Origin series match was played in May 1999.\n\nVictoria belted South Australia by 54 points in front of just over 26,000 people at the MCG.\n\nNo match was scheduled the following year, which had a shorter season than normal due to the Sydney Olympics.\n\nOne-off State of Origin matches have been held since, the most recent in 2020 to help raise money for the Black Summer bushfire victims.\n\nTrent Cotchin (right) and Nat Fyfe were selected as the respective captains for Victoria and All-Stars AFL State of Origin match in 2020. (AAP: Scott Barbour)\n\nThe AFL Players Association has long backed calls for a series resumption.\n\n\"While a return of State of Origin seems unlikely in the current climate, given schedule commitments and structure of the AFL season, the AFLPA remains open to a discussion with the players, AFL and clubs about this,\" a spokesperson said.\n\nThe AFL did not respond to requests for comment.\n\nTopic:NRL\n\nTopic:Paralympic Games\n\nTopic:Sport\n\nTopic:Police\n\nTopic:State of Origin\n\nTopic:Health\n\nAnalysis by Patricia Karvelas\n\nTopic:Foreign Aid\n\nTopic:Alternative Energy\n\nTopic:Courts\n\nTopic:Human Interest\n\nTopic:Australian Rules Football\n\nAnalysis by Dean Bilton\n\nTopic:Australian Rules Football\n\nAustralian Rules Football\n\nHobart\n\nMelbourne\n\nSport\n\nVFL\n\nTopic:Health\n\nAnalysis by Patricia Karvelas\n\nTopic:Foreign Aid\n\nTopic:Alternative Energy\n\nTopic:Courts\n\nTopic:World War 2\n\nTopic:Children's Health\n\nTopic:Activism and Lobbying\n\nTopic:Indigenous Culture\n\nWe acknowledge Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples as the First Australians and Traditional Custodians of the lands where we live, learn, and work.\n\nThis service may include material from Agence France-Presse (AFP), APTN, Reuters, AAP, CNN and the BBC World Service which is copyright and cannot be reproduced.\n\nAEST = Australian Eastern Standard Time which is 10 hours ahead of GMT (Greenwich Mean Time)"

Sign up for the First & 4Most morning newsletter — delivered to your inbox daily.\n\nAt the 2018 Winter Olympics, for example, Russian athletes who passed drug tests competed under the \"Olympic Athletes from Russia,\" or OAR, delegation.\n\nDuring the 2020 Olympics in Tokyo, Russian athletes competed under the \"Russian Olympic Committee,\" or ROC, delegation. \n\nWill Russia compete as ROC again at the 2024 Olympics in Paris? Here's what to know:\n\nROC at the Olympics refers to the \"Russian Olympic Committee,\" which is the name Russian athletes compete under since Russia is banned due to its involvement in the war with Ukraine. \n\nThe ROC name actually came to be at the Tokyo Olympics since Russia was banned by the World Anti-Doping Agency in 2019 for its state-sponsored doping program.\n\n\n\nHowever, the athletes approved to compete cannot use the Russian flag or national anthem throughout the Olympics.\n\nRussia will not compete as ROC in Paris. Instead, Russian athletes will fall under the Individual Neutral Athletes delegation, or AIN (IOC country code after the French name Athlètes Individuels Neutres).\n\nYes, Russian athletes can compete in Paris, but they must be approved to do so. The same applies to Belarusian competitors. As of June 15, there were a combined 25 Russian and Belarusian athletes who were approved to compete in neutral events. \n\nHowever, Russian and Belarusian athletes are barred from participating in the Paris Opening Ceremony.\n\nIt's not yet known how many Russian and Belarusian athletes will compete in Paris. However, the IOC did give an estimation. \n\n“The maximum number, which is unlikely to be reached, would be 55 and 28 respectively,” the IOC told CNN.\n\nFor comparison's sake, Russia had 330 athletes in Tokyo, while Belarus had 104."

The 38-year-old Welshman, winner of the 2018 Tour and third overall in the Giro d’Italia this year, is a surprise omission from the five-rider selection for the men’s road race and individual time trial events.\n\nStephen Park, British Cycling’s performance director, said of Thomas that “in his time-trialling, he’s not been in great form in our view”, ­adding: “We try to think carefully and consider all the evidence in front of us. Clearly he had a good Giro and is in the [Ineos Grenadiers] Tour de France team. But there is some incredible competition and in the road race we have only four riders we can pick.”\n\nIn recent years Thomas has been the only British rider to rival the serial champions Tadej Pogacar, Primoz Roglic and Jonas Vingegaard in Grand Tour stage racing. He was third in the 2022 Tour de France and second in the 2023 Giro, as well as coming third in the latter in May. “We decided that the younger riders would be in better form getting to the end of the Tour, physically and mentally,” Park said. “With a one-day race, it’s different and Geraint will be at the end of a very long season by the time he gets there.”\n\nThomas, a veteran of four Olympic Games and a gold medallist in the team pursuit at Beijing in 2008 and London 2012, told the Guardian in April: “I’d love to do one more Olympics, but I don’t want to go and just get another tracksuit. I want to be good enough to be in with a shout of a medal. I’ve got four tracksuits already – I don’t need another one.”\n\nDespite his podium finish in the Giro, in what was acknowledged as one of the hardest Grand Tours for many years, Thomas’s experience and consistency was not enough to secure a fifth Olympic appearance.\n\nThomas’s Ineos Grenadiers teammates Ethan Hayter and Josh ­Tarling, both recently crowned ­British national champions, and the Tokyo Olympic gold medallist Tom Pidcock, also a stage winner in the 2022 Tour de France, are included. They are joined by Stephen Williams, winner this season of La Flèche ­Wallonne, and the former British road race champion Fred Wright.\n\nThe women’s road team will not be confirmed until 4 July but is likely to include the British road race champion, Pfeiffer Georgi, the British time‑trial champion, Anna ­Henderson, and the London 2012 silver medallist Lizzie Deignan.\n\nDespite his top‑three finish in the Giro, Thomas will not be a designated leader either in the Tour de France, which starts in Florence on ­Saturday. His Ineos Grenadiers team will by led by Spain’s Carlos ­Rodríguez, fifth overall in 2023, and Colombian climber, Egan Bernal, winner in Paris in 2019.\n\n“Carlos has continued to impress us with his racing as well as his ­professionalism, on and off the bike,” the performance director, Scott Drawer, said.\n\nThomas, who will be starting his 13th Tour, is cited as “providing support” to Rodríguez and Bernal. “I didn’t know how I would feel after the Giro and getting back to training,” he said, “as I have never done the Giro-Tour double before. I thought it would be really hard to stay on it, but I’ve actually enjoyed it and got some good work done.”"

        "expanded content": "SAMMAMISH, Wash. — Standing in the 18th fairway, Amy Yang leaned over to caddie Jan Meierling and acknowledged the anxiety and nerves she carried for the previous 17 holes.\n\n“This has been the longest 18 holes I’ve ever played in my career,” Yang told Meierling.\n\nAfter years of near-misses in the majors, Yang finally enjoyed the celebration she’d long sought: standing on the 18th green, doused in champagne by her peers as a major champion.\n\n“At one point I thought, ‘Will I every win a major championship before I retire?’” Yang said. “And I finally did it and it’s just amazing.”\n\nSteady over four days at demanding, tree-lined Sahalee, Yang built a huge lead and survived a couple of late mistakes to win her long-awaited major title on Sunday, a three-shot victory in the KPMG Women’s PGA Championship.\n\nYang closed with an even-par 72 to finish at seven-under 281. She was nearly flawless for the first 15 holes and reached 10 under for the tournament for a seven-shot lead before running into a little bit of trouble. But none of her pursuers was able to mount a significant charge.\n\nAt age 34, Yang is the oldest major winner on the LPGA Tour since Angela Stanford won the 2018 Evian Championship at age 40. Anna Nordqvist had recently turned 34 when she won the Women’s British Open in 2021.\n\nThis was Yang’s 75th major start, the most before a player’s first major title since Stanford, who was playing her 76th. As she spoke to reporters, a group of children waited outside the interview tent, chanting “Amy, Amy,” and seeking an autograph from the newest major champ.\n\n“It’s been incredible all this week. Everyone was rooting for me. I want to go sign some autographs for them,” Yang said.\n\nYang’s sixth LPGA victory was her first since last year’s CME Group Tour Championship, which was also the most recent victory by a South Korean player. She earned a spot in the Paris Olympics, where she will represent South Korea for the third time.\n\n Sports \n\nBryson DeChambeau puts on a show, shooting a three-under 67 to take a three-shot lead in his quest to capture a second U.S. Open title.\n\n“The first half of the year she was kind of like in between. Motivation is kind of a roller-coaster ride for her because she’s done a lot of things, but there’s definitely some goals she wants to accomplish, this being one of them,” Meierling said. “These weeks get her reinvigorated.”\n\nLilia Vu and Jin Young Ko each shot 71 to tie for second at four under. Vu shot three rounds under par, but couldn’t overcome a 75 in the first round.\n\n“If [you] hit like Amy, you can win, too,” Ko said.\n\nTwice earlier in her career, Yang held the 54-hole lead in a major only to fall short. At the 2014 U.S. Women’s Open at Pinehurst, Yang was tied with Michelle Wie going into the final round but shot 74 as Wie won. A year later in the same tournament at Lancaster Country Club, Yang had a three-shot advantage, but In Gee Chun shot 66 to win by one.\n\nNine times, Yang finished second, third or fourth in a major without a title. Until now.\n\n“Golf is really just like a fight against myself. I think I proved myself that I can compete and I can do this,” she said.\n\nYang was remarkably steady until her final few holes. She made five bogeys over her first 69 holes before she three-putted the 16th. Then she pushed her tee shot on the par-three 17th well right and it bounced into a lake, leading to a double bogey.\n\nYang steadied herself with a perfect tee shot on the par-five 18th, leading to a two-putt par and the champagne celebration.\n\nYang held a two-shot advantage when she stepped to the first tee on a cooler Sunday after three straight days of above-average temperatures. The front nine saw breezes whistle through the towering trees to the point play had to be paused so pollen buds could be blown off the greens.\n\nYang was unfazed. By the time she made the turn, she led by five. Yang birdied the first hole, chipped in for birdie from 23 yards off the green on the fifth and dropped a 7-foot birdie putt on the eighth — the toughest hole on the course — to move to nine under.\n\nWhen Yang hit into the trees on No. 10 and made bogey, she responded with a birdie at the 11th and made her final birdie at the 13th.\n\nPlaying in the final group with Yang, Lauren Hartlage had a chance to tie the lead at eight under, but her 5-foot birdie try on the par-five sixth hole caught the left edge, spun around the cup and stayed out. Hartlage made double bogeys at Nos. 7 and 8 and made the turn six shots behind. She tied for fifth at three under, her best career finish.\n\nThere was only one round in the 60s on the final day — Japan’s Mao Saigo shot 67 to finish at two under, tied for seventh.\n\nGo beyond the scoreboard\n\nGet the latest on L.A.'s teams in the daily Sports Report newsletter.\n\n You may occasionally receive promotional content from the Los Angeles Times. \n\n Sports \n\n Sports \n\n Sports \n\n Sports \n\n Dodgers \n\n Angels \n\n Sports \n\n Sports \n\nSubscribe for unlimited accessSite Map\n\nFollow Us\n\nMORE FROM THE L.A.

That's why my back gets sore and that's why I get cramp.'\n\n2009\n\nMurray then remained relatively injury-free throughout the early years of his professional career before his entry into the US Open in 2009.\n\nAfter reaching the final of the competition the year before, there were high hopes for Murray but the Scottish star was hampered by a wrist injury and suffered a straight-sets loss to Marin Cilic at the tournament.\n\nThen, at the Davis Cup, Murray won both his singles matches but then missed six weeks with a wrist injury.\n\nIn 2006, Murray struggled with a neck injury as he competed on the circuit for the first time\n\n2011\n\nThe next spate of injuries for Murray came two years later, after elbow issues forced the Scot to withdraw from the Barcelona Open.\n\nHowever, the injury was not severe enough to derail Murray's season and, the following year, he won his first ever major; the US Open.\n\nIn the same year, he also clinched gold at the London 2012 Olympics by defeating the Swiss maestro Roger Federer on Centre Court. \n\n2013\n\nAt the Rome Masters in 2013, Murray was once again forced to retire due to a hip injury - which would cause issues throughout his career moving forward - during his second-round match against Marcel Granollers on his 26th birthday.\n\nMurray was then left with just 10 days to recover for the French Open but pulled out prior to the competition, citing a back injury.\n\nHowever, after four weeks out, Murray made his return from injury and went on to win Wimbledon for the first time in his career - where he defeated Novak Djokovic in straight sets.\n\nHowever, his season prematurely to undergo back surgery, hoping to finally address the persistent issue that had been troubling him for years.\n\nAt the Rome Masters in 2013, Murray was once again forced to retire due to a hip injury\n\nThe issue gave him minimal time to recover before the French Open, which he withdrew from\n\n2017\n\nMurray enjoyed a few years untroubled by his injury struggles, however, 2017 was about to change all of that. \n\nThe British star produced a shaky performance at Queens and was defeated in the first round but made no mentioned of any injuries.\n\nShortly after, he was knocked out of Wimbledon - as the reigning champion - in the quarter-finals, where he walked with a noticeable limp during his defeat to Sam Querrey.\n\nHe then missed out on a Grand Slam, the US Open, for the first time in his career due to his hip injury. \n\nTwo days before the tournament he announced he was pulling out, claiming that his hip was too sore to give him a chance of winning.\n\nHe then confirmed that he would miss the rest of the 2017 season and even suggested that another significant injury setback could lead to his retirement.\n\n'If my body is in good shape and I'm still able to compete consistently, I'll keep playing,' Murray said. \n\n'But I can't look so far in advance with the age I'm at and with the issues I've had. If I was to have a big injury, I probably wouldn't try to come back from that.'\n\nMurray's hip caused him serious problems in 2017 before he had surgery on it two years later\n\n2018\n\nThe following year, Murray scheduled the Brisbane International for his comeback but was forced to withdraw from the competition on the night before his first game. Later that week, Murray announced he had undergone hip surgery in Melbourne. \n\nIn June, 342 days since his last competitive outing, Murray finally makes a return to the tennis court in the Fever-Tree Championships against Nick Kyrgios.\n\nHowever, he was still forced to withdraw from Wimbledon after saying his right hip was still not ready for the demands of a Grand Slam.\n\n2019\n\nIn January, at a press conference just before the Australian Open, Murray announced that he could possibly retire from tennis due to struggling physically for a 'long time'.\n\n'I've been in a lot of pain for probably 20 months now,' Murray confessed. 'I've pretty much done everything I could to get my hip feeling better. It hasn't helped loads.'\n\nAt the end of the month, Murray announced on Instagram that he had undergone hip resurfacing surgery and hoped that it would spell 'the end of my hip pain'.\n\nIn March, Murray claimed that he was free of pain in his hip, thanks to the surgery, and may return to playing competitive tennis.\n\nHe did in fact make his return at the Queen's Club tournament for the doubles, where he and Feliciano Lopez won the title.\n\nHowever, in late December, Murray's team confirmed that the pelvic injury which had curtailed his involvement in the Davis Cup would also prevent him from entering the upcoming 2020 Australian Open and the inaugural ATP Cup.\n\nMurray seemed set to retire this year after failing to overcome a longstanding hip injury \n\n2021\n\nAfter a quiet 2020, Murray returned the following year before suffering a groin injury during the Miami Open in March which, in turn, ruled him out of the French Open. \n\nIt was during this year that the Scot admitted he was one 'big injury' away from retirement.\n\n2023\n\nLast year, Murray was forced to retire from the Cincinnati Open due to an abdominal injury and, in November, he withdrew from the Davis Cup after suffering a shoulder injury in training.\n\n2024\n\nMurray's 2024 had begun promisingly however the Scot ruptured an ankle ligament in Miami in March which ruled him out for two months. \n\nIt looked a long shot that he would be fit for the French Open but Murray consulted medical experts and decided not to have surgery. \n\nHe made his return at the Queen's Club Championships but lasted just five games against Australia’s Jordan Thompson in the second-round before retiring.\n\n‘I have been struggling with my back for a while,’ he said. ‘Then I had loss of power in my right leg. Loss of motor control, had no coordination. Couldn't move.\n\n‘My back's been sore in the build-up to the tournament. It was pretty sore in my match yesterday (against Alexei Popryin). I wasn't comfortable playing but I was able to manage it.\n\nMurray has withdrawn from Queen's with injury less han two weeks before Wimbledon \n\nMurray, 37, heroically tried to carry on after treatment but only lasted five games overall\n\n‘During my pre-match warmup (before the Thompson match), I was pretty uncomfortable, and then I walked up the stairs to go out. Just before going on the court, I didn't have the usual strength in my right leg. It was not a usual feeling.\n\n‘Then the first two balls I hit in the warmup, my right leg, it was so uncoordinated. Just was not working properly.’\n\nAfterwards, it was confirmed that the 37-year-old had surgery to remove a cyst from his spine and there were reports recently that the operation had ruled him out of Wimbledon.\n\nSubsequent tests revealed a cyst had developed which had to be surgically removed. The recovery time for the procedure is around four weeks for a 'normal’ adult and while his team were hopeful that someone of Murray’s build and fitness could respond quickly, he could not get right in time for Wimbledon.\n\n\n\t    Share what you think\n          \n\nThe comments below have not been moderated.\n\n\n      The views expressed in the contents above are those of our users and do not necessarily reflect the views of MailOnline.\n    \n\nWe are no longer accepting comments on this article.\n\nPublished by Associated Newspapers Ltd\n\nPart of the Daily Mail, The Mail on Sunday & Metro Media Group"

After that flawless third run Brown smiled broadly and nodded knowing she had done enough to reach Paris.\n\nTambling, from Cornwall, was 24th with a best score of 67.61, enough for Olympics qualification after she finished sixth at the world championships and also won the British national championships.\n\nTeam GB posted on X: “Sky Brown: 15 years old. Lola Tambling: 16 years old. Andy MacDonald: 50 years old. All three skateboarders have QUALIFIED for @Paris2024 through the #OlympicQualifierSeries! Age is just a number.”\n\nMacDonald, who hails from Massachusetts, started skateboarding aged 12 and turned professional in 1994 – 14 years before Brown was born in Miyazaki, Japan.\n\nHe spent his career competing alongside his friend Tony Hawk and holds the record for the number of vert medals won at the X Games. MacDonald is eligible for the British team via his father and will compete in the men’s park.\n\nSign up to The Recap\n\nThe best of our sports journalism from the past seven days and a heads-up on the weekend’s action\n\nafter newsletter promotion\n\n“I watch kids fall and hurt themselves, and think: ‘If I took that slam I’d be out for a week,’” MacDonald told the Guardian in January. “It just takes way longer to heal, the older you get. The physical side of it is a constant reminder: ‘Yeah, you’re old.’”\n\nMacDonald will turn 51 on 31 July, five days after the Paris Games begin, while Brown’s 16th birthday falls on 12 July.\n\n“It’s what keeps me young,” MacDonald told Olympics.com when competing at the qualifiers in Shanghai last month. “You don’t get old and quit skateboarding. You quit skateboarding and get old. I’ve never stopped doing it. It’s my mental health, it’s my physical health. Whether I was competing or not, I’d still be doing it anyway.”"

Going on his podcast during the middle of the year. He’s a basketball genius, as everybody knows. I think he’s going to make a good coach and I can’t wait to get to work with him.”\n\nThe honeymoon stage with a coach is always positive, but this is a breath of fresh air compared to how things were last season under Darvin Ham. \n\nIt wasn't that players bashed the former Lakers head coach, but it was more about what wasn't said. Quotes from players praising the coaching staff and game plans were hard to come by. \n\nAnthony Davis even said the Lakers 'don't know what we're doing' at times in the middle of the team's playoff series against the Nuggets. \n\nWhat was even wilder was Darvin Ham pushing back on that statement, saying he \"agrees to disagree\" with the star forward. \n\nCompare that to this high praise from Reaves calling Redick a \"basketball genius,\" and you can see that, at least in the beginning, the vibes around the Lakers will be better at the start of this season compared to how they were at the end of the last one. \n\nReaves also had friction with Ham and called it a \"tough\" situation being benched early last season. \n\nUnder Redick, hopefully, no demotion will happen and Reaves can take a bigger leap in his development. \n\nThe Lakers guard averaged 15.9 points and 5.5 rebounds, both career highs, but most feel there is more potential there. \n\nIf Redick is the one who can unlock the best version of Reaves, that could take the Lakers back near the top of the Western Conference and out of the play-in standings they've been living under the last two seasons. \n\nReaves seems excited about Redick as the coach and the Lakers clearly were as well since they hired him. Now, we just need to wait to see it all put together. \n\nThere are many weeks left for that, though, as we still have to get through the NBA Draft, free agency and the Olympics before we can see how Redick and Reaves gel.\n\nYou can follow Edwin on Twitter at @ECreates88.\n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCheck your inbox for a welcome email.\n\nOops.

(Getty Images: Cameron Smith)\n\nAjla Tomljanovic's brilliant return to tennis has hit a new peak as the Australian ace reached her first WTA grass court final in the Birmingham Classic to stand on the verge of the biggest triumph of her 15-year career.\n\nTomljanovic's 7-6 (7-5), 6-4 victory over Russian seventh seed Anastasia Potapova in the pre-Wimbledon tournament at Edgbaston on Saturday left the 31-year-old quite emotional, as she clenched her fists tight and looked to the heavens.\n\n\"I definitely didn't expect to play a final here. I really take it one match at a time, as cliched as it is,\" beamed the player who was Australian number one this time last year before a series of injury, illness and surgery setbacks saw her world ranking plummet to its current 190.\n\nBut Tomljanovic, the Australian number 10, stands to shoot back to number three while soaring back to number 116 in the world should she defeat old Kazakh rival Yulia Putintseva in Sunday's unexpected match-up between two non-seeds.\n\nIt's also a fantastic boost for Tomljanovic as she prepares for Wimbledon — where she's twice reached the quarterfinal — before representing Australia at the Paris Olympics.\n\n\"Whenever I've done well, I've never looked ahead, and I'm not going to do it now either,\" she said.\n\n\"I'm going to do my best to prepare, give it my all tomorrow, and when it's over, reflect on the week.\"\n\nAfter missing most of 2023 with a knee injury and requiring surgery this year to remove uterine fibroids, it would represent an extraordinary achievement if Tomljanovic was to lift a WTA crown in her 180th main draw.\n\nABC Sport Daily is your daily sports conversation. We dive into the biggest story of the day and get you up to speed with everything else that's making headlines.\n\nHer record against Putintseva — who is as feisty on court as she is cheerful off it — is not great, having lost four of their five meetings, but they've never played on grass, and Tomljanovic is striking the ball beautifully on her favoured surface after only being back for the past month following four months sidelined.\n\nTomljanovic did win a WTA 125 event in Brazil at the end of last year, but that's seen by the women's governing body as effectively a second-tier Challenger trophy, so victory at Edgbaston Priory would be considered Tomljanovic's first tour-level title after losing four previous finals.\n\nTomljanovic dominated world number 36 Potapova early on, cashing in on a series of early double faults from the Russian, who dished up seven in all.\n\nTomljanovic was broken when serving for the set at 5-4, yet held her nerve better in the subsequent tiebreak as the often erratic Potapova made two backhand errors to gift the stanza to the Australian.\n\nAfter the match went with serve in the second, scoreboard pressure again cranked up on Potapova, Tomljanovic breaking her to 15 to annex the victory in just over an hour-and-a-half.\n\nJordan Thompson lost his semi-final against Lorenzo Musetti and suffered a back injury. (Getty Images: Zac Goodwin)\n\nMeanwhile at the Queen's Club Championship, Australian Jordan Thompson suffered the double agony of a narrow defeat to Lorenzo Musetti in the biggest semifinal of his career being compounded by a back injury.\n\nThompson, playing the first semi-final of an ATP 500 event in his 11-year career, put up a fight to forge back after losing the first set but eventually succumbed 6-3, 3-6, 6-3 to the graceful Italian, who'd also beaten Australian No.1 Alex de Minaur earlier in the week.\n\nWorse still, Thompson's big day ended with him having to leave Queen's to get treated for the back injury that he suffered early in the second set.\n\nThe Australian number two had planned to fly off to Mallorca after the London event to play in a final warm-up tournament before Wimbledon.\n\nBut with the extent of his injury problem yet to be determined, he was left admitting ruefully when asked if he would still be playing in Spain: \"Probably 99 per cent no.

Today, we rank the top-10 swims of the meet.\n\nJune 21st, 2024  Diving, National, News, U.S. Olympic Trials\n\nOn Tuesday night, two of the most accomplished athletes in Mike Parratto‘s life reached the top.\n\nAround 7:57 p.m. that night, Parratto was sitting in the stands at the Allen Jones Aquatic Center in Knoxville, Tennessee. His daughter Jessica, alongside her diving partner Delaney Schnell, had just completed a dominant sixth round in the women’s synchronized platform diving event and were headed to the Paris Olympics. Around 40 minutes later, Mike Parratto went to the other side of the building and pulled up the Peacock app on his phone (which he made sure was charged between sessions for this exact purpose) to watch Regan Smith race the women’s 100 backstroke final at the 2024 U.S. Olympic trials. Smith, who Parratto coached from 2015 to 2021 at the Riptide Swim Club in Lakeville, Minnesota, broke the world record in the event to claim her first world record in five years.\n\nJessica Parratto and Smith, in two very different stages of their career, went on two very different journeys to make their respective Paris Olympic teams. But connecting the two of them was a man who played an important role in both of their lives, prideful through it all.\n\n“For me to watch [Jessica’s] diving event, to watch Regan’s swim event, it was very rewarding to see all the hard work that they’ve done,” Mike Parratto said.\n\nJessica Parratto, currently 29, became a three-time Olympian on Tuesday. Already a 2021 Tokyo Olympic silver medalist with Schnell, she chose to retire from the sport shortly afterward to pursue a professional career as a healthcare recruiter, assisting nurses in the emergency room. To work that job, she moved away from her training base at Indiana University in Bloomington, Indiana to Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.\n\nHowever, in early 2023, Schnell reached out to Parratto, successfully convincing her to come back to diving. Because diving involved at least four to five hours of training every day, Parratto couldn’t work her full-time job anymore, and returned to Bloomington. The pairing won bronze in platform synchro at the 2023 World Championships, and are now set to defend their Olympic medal.\n\n“From my perspective, she felt like she wasn’t done,” Mike Parratto said. “There’s always that love for the sport and coming back and seeing how good you can be.”\n\nMeanwhile, Smith is only 22, but she’s already been through a lot in her young career. After breaking the 100 and 200 back world records under Mike Parratto 2019 as 17-year-old, she faced a mental block and struggled to replicate those times for the next four years. In 2021, she left Riptide to swim for Stanford University, but cut her collegiate career short just a year later to train at Arizona State for Bob Bowman as a pro. After two years with Bowman, she finally began hitting best times in backstroke again.\n\nThree years later, Parratto reflects on the Tokyo Olympic cycle, where Smith had all the momentum after 2019. He felt that it was disrupted by the COVID-19 pandemic, which delayed the Olympics by a year and messed with the four-year plan they had created together that was meant to span from 2016 to 2020. In addition, their pool access during the pandemic became limited.\n\n“I hate to use COVID as an excuse, but to some degree, it was,” Parratto said. “You have to come up with another one year plan to keep going. Some of the training that we had done became less than it was in the past, so there were no double practices.”\n\nHowever, now Parratto can step back and know that everything ended up working out in the end, even if it took time.\n\nParratto and Smith keep in touch, as Smith still sends Parratto the sets that she does with Bowman. But that doesn’t mean he’s looking over any shoulders — Parratto thinks that Bowman is the perfect coaching fit for Smith.\n\n“The training that Bob [Bowman] does is made for [Smith],” Parratto said. “She’s in a situation where she’s training with [the best in the world], medal winners…and then of course, she gets long course any time they decide to train long course. So all those factors made it all work, and it’s been a lot of help to her.”\n\nThe experiences of coaching an an elite athlete and parenting one can seem like two vastly different things. However, Parratto approaches both actions with a similar mindset — simply being supportive and letting the athletes make their own life decisions.\n\nParratto is a little more hands-off with Jessica, given that his wife Amy is a diving coach who used to coach their daughter as a child. And although he designed sets for Smith and guided her swimming in the past, he allowed her then to be in charge of her own major career choices. Now that Smith is off with Bowman, he just sits and and enjoys how her career pans out.\n\n“As a parent, as a person, you want the best for them. You want to do what’s right for them,” Parratto said. “That includes having them make their own decisions. It has to be their decision. You can’t want it more than they want it, it’s their thing. Whether it’s Jessica, whether it’s Regan, they decide what they want.”\n\n“A relationship has to be a little bit more than ‘here’s the training.’ It’s working with somebody. Athletics can be very emotional, as we’ve seen here this week at trials. That’s a lifetime of training. There’s a lot of time and effort that’s put in. And the process is really, really important. And as a coach, or even as a parent, you’re involved in that process with them.”\n\nAfter Tuesday night’s diving session ended, the Parratto family went out to dinner to celebrate Jessica Parratto‘s Olympic berth and her birthday, which falls on June 26. Mike Parratto got an hour and a half of sleep, and then flew to Indianapolis on Wednesday morning to support his former and current swimmers at Olympic trials. As long as he stays in the sports world, he’ll get to witness amazing things from people in his life — like he did when he developed eight-time Olympic gold medalist Jenny Thompson, like he did with Smith, and like he did with his own daughter. But not many moments in his life, at least those related to athletics, will match that forty-minute span on Tuesday night.\n\n\n\nΔ\n\n\n\nΔ\n\nMike was my coach over 20 years ago. As a high schooler he turned me from a kid who could not do flip turns to a D1 athlete. Forever grateful!\n\nMike had a very good Tuesday.\n\nMike – “Oh, what a day I’m having!!”\n\nBest coach ever! Mike was my coach 37 years ago and I can still talk to him today and feel like it all was just yesterday; he hasn’t changed a bit. He and Amy are the greatest – so happy for them & their whole family.\n\nThere is also a synchronised duo named Cook Bacon (3m Spring W), which is going to be the most hilarious once commentators say this. The double Bacon surname in the US aquatic team for Paris is gonna be lit\n\n😁\n\nSadly Sarah is not a swimmer and Phoebe is not a diver. The pairing of Bacon and Bacon would have been great.\n\nDiving and Swimming are part of aquatic sports\n\nI agree with Mia and MarkB!

(AP Photo/Abbie Parr, file)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCHICAGO (AP) — The Bulls and Thunder finalized a deal sending Josh Giddey to Chicago and Alex Caruso to Oklahoma City on Friday, with the Thunder granting the 21-year-old Giddey’s trade request after he resisted the team’s plans to use him off the bench.\n\nGiddey, a 6-foot-8 point guard from Australia, gets a fresh start after a challenging season in which his numbers dropped and he lost his starting job in the playoffs.\n\nIn a statement, Thunder general manager Sam Presti said he told Giddey after the season that the team envisioned using him as as a reserve in 2024-25 “to maximize his many talents and deploy our team more efficiently over 48 minutes.”\n\n“As we laid out to Josh how he could lean into his strengths and ultimately optimize our current roster and talent, it was hard to for him to envision, and conversations turned to him inquiring about potential opportunities elsewhere,” Presti said. “As always was the case, Josh demonstrated the utmost professionalism throughout the discussions.”\n\nThe Thunder went 57-25 to earn the top seed in the Western Conference and lost to Dallas in the conference semifinals.\n\nGiddey was frequently booed on the road this season after an anonymous social media user accused him of having an improper relationship with an underage girl, leading to investigations by police in Newport Beach, California, and the NBA.\n\nNewport Beach police completed their investigation in January and said detectives were “unable to corroborate any criminal activity.” The NBA also later dropped its investigation.\n\n\n\n\nGiddey was the No. 6 overall pick in 2021 and he made the All-Rookie second team. He is a member of Australia’s national team that will play at the Paris Olympics this summer. He is an exceptional passer and his size makes him a solid rebounder.\n\nGiddey averaged 16.6 points, 7.9 rebounds and 6.2 assists in his second season, but those numbers dropped to 12.3 points, 6.4 rebounds and 4.8 assists in 2023-24. \n\nGiddey’s play improved the second half of this season after the Thunder traded for Gordon Hayward. In April regular-season games, Giddey averaged 16.3 points, 7.0 rebounds and 5.5 assists while shooting 57.2% from the field.\n\nGiddey’s playing time was reduced in the playoffs. He opened the second-round series against Dallas as a starter before being moved to a reserve role for the first time in his NBA career.\n\nThe 30-year-old Caruso, who plays point guard and shooting guard, was undrafted in 2016 and played for the Thunder’s G League affiliate, the Oklahoma City Blue, in 2016-17. He established himself as a defensive presence in four years with the Los Angeles Lakers and then three years with the Bulls.\n\nHe has career averages of 6.8 points, 2.9 rebounds and 2.9 assists. He averaged a career-high 10.1 points this past season. He was on the all-defense first team in 2023 and the second team in 2024.\n\n“Alex Caruso is a player we have always highly valued and followed,” Presti said. “He is the quintessential Thunder player; he is an exceptional competitor and teammate with a multi-dimensional skillset.”\n\nThe Thunder also have Cason Wallace, a second-team All-Rookie selection this past season, at point guard.\n\n___\n\nAP NBA: https://apnews.com/hub/NBA\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCopyright 2025 The Associated Press.

Read our Privacy notice\n\nAndy Murray will undergo surgery on his back on Saturday after suffering an injury at Queen’s Club.\n\nThe 37-year-old is hoping to make a farewell appearance at Wimbledon, and that has not yet been ruled out despite Murray going under the knife just over a week before the tournament.\n\nThe Scot struggled from the start of his second-round match against Jordan Thompson on Wednesday and pulled out after only five games.\n\nA statement from his management said: “Andy is having a procedure on his back tomorrow. We will know more after this has taken place and will update further as soon as possible.”\n\nMurray described feeling a weakness in his right leg and losing coordination. He sought on-court treatment after three games but soon decided he could not continue.\n\nOn his chances of competing at SW19, Murray said: “Like all tennis players, we have degenerative joints and stuff in the back but it’s all predominantly been left-sided for me my whole career.\n\n“I have never had too many issues with the right side. So maybe there is something that can be done between now and then to help the right side.”\n\nThis is not the first time Murray has suffered a back problem in his career. He underwent surgery in 2013, while after a first-round loss at the French Open last month he revealed he would need treatment to address soreness.\n\nThe three-time grand slam champion only returned to the match court five weeks ago after nearly two months out with an ankle injury.\n\nHe is due to play singles and doubles with his brother Jamie at Wimbledon before potentially bringing his career to a close at the Olympics in Paris, but both of those are now in doubt.\n\nJoin thought-provoking conversations, follow other Independent readers and see their replies\n\nPlease refresh the page or navigate to another page on the site to be automatically logged inPlease refresh your browser to be logged in"

He wore a similar style suit with a light blue tie and a burnt orange tie.\n\nNow, William, who is still familiar with a good suit and clean shaven face, is slightly poorer in hair, but all the more wealthy in wisdom and charm.\n\nThe pair are pictured - with Y2K style - in 1999\n\nWilliam and Frederik are both great grandsons of Queen Victoria\n\nThe ruddy faced rugby player is no longer with his arm in a sling, but is the new heir, following the death of the Queen which made Charles King in 2022, and subsequently the Prince of Wales\n\nWilliam married Kate Middleton in 2011 and the couple now share three children, George, 10, Charlotte, 9, and Louis, 6.\n\nToday, Frederick still wears rough, rugged looking beard with short hair, though the black has turned to grey and the King is appears much more open with his fashion these days.\n\nThe former Prince of Denmark, now the King as on January 2024, is married to Mary Elizabeth Donaldson, an Australian marketing consultant  the prince had met while attending the Olympics just a year after the christening of Constantine Alexios.\n\nWilliam and Frederick shook hands with beaming faces at the Euros on Thursday.

She was a singles quarterfinalist there in 2022.\n\nThe 30-year-old Collins, who has said this will be her final season on the tour, has won two titles this year in Miami and Charleston.

He will celebrate his 26th birthday in the City of Love next week.\n\nWhen approached by Channel 7 reporter Hayden Nelson on Friday, both he and Løyning were reluctant to elaborate on their special news.\n\nChalmers’ relationship with the 23-year-old Løyning has been a great source of fascination due to his high-profile ‘love triangle’ days with Australian mega-star Emma McKeon and Cody Simpson.\n\nIn December last year Løyning — a backstroker who moved to Adelaide in March 2023 to prepare for the Paris Olympics — confirmed she was dating Chalmers, telling a Norwegian news channel that they had been an item for around 12 months.\n\n“Yes, we are a couple,” she confirmed.\n\n2 min read\n\n2 min read\n\n“We have been there for quite some time, since around December.\n\n“That is not the whole reason, but one of the reasons why I went down to train in Australia.”\n\nUp until then, the couple had been very quiet about their relationship but now they are loud and proud.\n\nAFL stars and Australian sporting royalty were all quick to celebrate the engagement news when it caught their eye.\n\nAustralian 1500m swimming legend Grant Hackett shared a message of congratulations as did current swim great Ariarne Titmus.\n\nFreestyler Shayna Jack wrote, “Congratulations to you both”, while gun AFL midfielder Clayton Oliver said: “King and queen.”\n\nFormer Aussie freestyle champion Brett Hawke said: “To an epic life together.”\n\nAnd Aussie world champ Sam Short wrote: “I would say simp, but this is awesome. Congrats man.”\n\nEven English breaststroker Adam Peaty chipped in with: “Congratulations both”, while Australian middle-distance runner Stewart McSweyn shared the sentiment.\n\nChalmers (who is often referred to as ‘King Kyle’) is bidding to become the first Australian to win two Olympic gold medals in the men’s 100m freestyle at next month’s Paris Games.\n\nBut he has revealed he is battling a serious back injury and a degenerative spine issue.\n\nAfter qualifying for his pet event in the recent Australian trials, it came out that he had now taken 10 cortisone injections in his back during his swim career.\n\n“It got pretty stiff and then the Saturday morning, I tried to do a dive and it just all spasmed and locked up,” he said.\n\n“I saw physios and doctors and the best thing I could do was to get four cortisones in my lower back and try to get moving again.\n\n“I am just grateful to be here racing and be back on the mend.\n\n“I know that I can get it right in six weeks’ time (for the Olympics).\n\n“I have put on a pretty brave face to be able to get through but it has definitely been quite challenging.”\n\nAlmost five years ago, Chalmers had a second round of heart surgery to correct a condition called supraventricular tachycardia — in layman’s terms, his heart would sometimes beat irregularly fast.\n\nHe has also had shoulder surgeries and suffered various other injuries, as well as mental health battles.\n\n“The good thing is that mentally and emotionally I’m in a very, very good spot,” he said.\n\n“I’m able to rise above the adversity and the challenges that have been thrown at me.”\n\n1 min read\n\n3 min read\n\nStream free on\n\n3 min read\n\n1 min read\n\n3 min read\n\n2 min read\n\n2 min read\n\n2 min read\n\n1 min read\n\n2 min read\n\n3 min read\n\n1 min read\n\n3 min read\n\n2 min read\n\n2 min read\n\n2 min read\n\n1 min read\n\n2 min read\n\nStay informed with the free 7NEWS app. Available on iOS & Android."

        "expanded content": "RTÉ Sport Journalist\n\nNiamh Briggs doesn't believe Vikki Wall’s failure to make the Ireland Sevens squad for the Olympic Games will damage one of the women’s pathways to rugby.\n\nA double All-Ireland winner with Meath, Wall was the highest profile former Gaelic footballer to make a switch to rugby when she signed an IRFU contract last September with the goal of making it to Paris for the Games this summer.\n\nHowever, the 26-year-old, who played a season with North Melbourne in AFLW, was missing from the list when Allan Temple-Jones named his 12-player squad for the tournament on Monday.\n\nAsked if it would have a negative effect of other Gaelic footballers trying their hand at rugby, Briggs told RTÉ Sport: \"Absolutely not. Vikki Wall is an incredible athlete.\n\n\"She’s also incredibly talented, making that move to the AFL for the year.\n\n\"When you get to Olympics and national level sports you want to have that depth of competition and I’ve no doubt that both the Sevens [squad] and Vikki are better players and in a better place than they were 12 months ago.\n\n\"She’s been incredibly unlucky, and I know all the hard work that goes into all those Sevens players to get on the pitch every day.\n\n\"It’s an incredible sport and I’ve the utmost admiration for them. I don’t think it’s damaging.\n\n\"If you are a competitive animal and you want to compete at the highest levels you are going to go and try to do that to the best of your ability.\n\n\"That Olympics squad is incredibly strong and from my own point of view I wish them the very best and I can’t wait to watch them.\"\n\nBriggs was speaking after she named her 36-player training squad for the U20s Six Nations tournament, which takes place in Italy between 4-14 July.\n\nA former out-half with Ireland and part of the senior coaching set-up before taking over the Under-20s squad, Briggs is better-placed than most to comment on how the schools, clubs and underage representative structures are working.\n\n\"As somebody who’s is working full-time in the pathways for the last year you can see straight away the hard work that has gone in,\" said the former Munster player.\n\n\"We’re getting athletes that are coming through that are definitely better athletes in terms of their physical ability but also their rugby know-how, which is massive.\n\n\"It means that in these camps we can push our knowledge quicker and get there faster where we need to go.\n\n\"It creates a huge amount of strength in depth, which is what we have been craving for a long time.\n\n\"When you look at the U18 girls in the Six Nations and this 20s squad the depth of competition, there are genuine conversations around players that are in and out.\n\n\"It’s been huge. We’re still a relatively young sport in Ireland and I think crossover athletes are going to be huge for us in order to maximise talent that’s around.\n\n\"We will never discount them. Our playing pool isn’t big enough for us to do that so it’s still going to be really important.\n\n\"So yeah, it’s a brilliant opportunity for these players and there’s definitely a noticeable difference in terms of their ability and the level that they are coming through at.\"\n\nListen to the RTÉ Rugby podcast on Apple Podcasts, Spotify or wherever you get your podcasts.\n\nWe need your consent to load this YouTube contentWe use YouTube to manage extra content that can set cookies on your device and collect data about your activity.

Love you my Barbie Doll,” Reese posted along with a photo of the two at the WNBA draft in April. \n\nBrink was averaging 8.1 points 5.7 rebounds and 2.5 blocks going into Tuesday’s game when she suffered the injury less than four minutes into the contest. \n\nShe had to be helped to the sideline, and once there, had to be carried to the Sparks’ locker room. \n\nClark offered her best when speaking about the injury Wednesday.\n\n“Obviously devastating. You never want to see anybody deal with any sort of injury, obviously an injury of that magnitude,” Clark said before scoring 18 points and grabbing 12 rebounds in the Fever’s 88-81 win over Mystics, their third in a row. \n\n“I know she’s the type of person that will be able to get through it and come out through it stronger. Just breaks your heart,” Clark said. ” She’s such a good basketball player, but an even better person. … She was obviously having a great start to her rookie season and then seeing something obviously so devastating like this, but I know she’ll come back stronger. \n\n“I know so many people are thinking of her and praying for her and I’m sure she’s overwhelmed by the support right now. Knowing the type of person she is, this will only make her better in the long run.”\n\nThe injury not only ends Brink’s WNBA season but her Olympic dreams as well. \n\nThe injury will force her to miss the 3×3 basketball competition at the 2024 Summer Olympics in Paris.\n\nAdvertisement"

Brink played under four minutes and committed one foul before getting hurt.\n Once over to the sideline, the No 2 pick in this year’s draft hobbled toward the locker room, but was forced to stop as a result of the pain. A pair of Sparks personnel lifted Brink off her feet and carried her to the locker room.\n\n“You never think it will happen to you,” Brink wrote Wednesday on Instagram. “And despite all the hard work sometimes it does. This is hard to fathom but I know it will only make me stronger. I will not be derailed and I will continue to love this life.\n\n“I’m not defined by basketball, but it is something that I love deeply and I will work everyday to get back to it.

As a result of Cam’s injury, USA Basketball will begin the process of selecting an athlete to join the 2024 USA 3x3 Women’s National Team,” USA Basketball said in a statement. “We hope to see Cam back on the court and representing the red, white and blue soon.”\n\nIt’s the second consecutive Olympics that the US team will have to replace one of its original players. Katie Lou Samuelson missed the 2021 Tokyo Games after she caught Covid right before the Olympics. She was replaced by Jackie Young, who helped the team go on to win a gold medal.\n The Sparks head to New York to play two games against the Liberty on Thursday and Saturday."

I’m seeing her games on ESPN every other other day. I’m seeing talks around her, no matter what they’re talking about, there’s a lot of dialogue around the game right now, so that’s good as well.\n\n“I think if she continues to keep getting better as a player, her production on the court gets better, then the league will grow. … There are just so many great players in our league that Caitlin has helped shine that light on them, and that’ll help the league grow over time.” \n\nDurant is the U.S. men’s Olympic basketball’s all-time leading scorer and will be going to Paris next month to take part in this year’s Games. \n\nClark has expressed no ill will or disappointment in not being selected for the Olympic roster and it has been reported that she is one of the top alternates for Team USA."

(AP Photo/Frank Franklin II)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCROMWELL, Conn. (AP) — No hard feelings, Rory.\n\nPGA Tour Commissioner Jay Monahan said he understands why Rory McIlroy withdrew from the Travelers Championship — the final signature event on the calendar — to recover from a late-Sunday meltdown at the U.S. Open.\n\n“Sometimes you just need to focus on what you need,” Monahan said on Wednesday, a day before the tournament at TPC River Highlands outside of Hartford. “And that’s what he’s doing and that’s exactly what he should be doing because that’s what he thinks is the right path.”\n\nMcIlroy twice had a one-shot lead at Pinehurst No. 2 before he bogeyed three of the last four holes, missing a pair of par putts from inside 4 feet. Instead of McIlroy’s fifth major championship — and his first in 10 years — Bryson DeChambeau claimed his second.\n\nOn Monday, McIlroy said on social media that he would be taking three weeks off to “build myself back up.” He is planning to return July 10-13 for the Scottish Open, where he is the defending champion, followed by the British Open the following week at Royal Troon in Scotland.\n\nWithout him, there will be 71 players teeing off on Thursday in the limited field, no-cut signature event at the TPC River Highlands. McIlroy is the only one in the top eight in the world ranking or the top 30 in the FedEx Cup standings who will miss it.\n\n“You look at the quality of the field that we have this week, we’re going to have a great Travelers Championship,” Monahan said. “And I’m looking forward to getting Rory back in Scotland.”\n\nThe Travelers Championship is the one week of the year that Keegan Bradley has bragging rights over world No. 1 Scottie Scheffler.\n\nNot only is Bradley the defending champion at the TPC River Highlands, but the native New Englander can remind his Texan rival how the NBA Finals turned out. Bradley’s Boston Celtics beat Scheffler’s Dallas Mavericks in a Game 5 clincher on Monday night.\n\nAsked about arriving in Celtics country so soon after Boston won its unprecedented 18th NBA championship, Scheffler joked, “Do I have to answer that question?” Scheffler said he hasn’t heard any razzing on the course but one fan asked him to sign a Celtics hat.\n\nHe declined.\n\n“I don’t blame him,” Bradley said. “I wouldn’t want to either if I was a Dallas fan.”\n\nBradley grew up in Vermont, New Hampshire and Massachusetts as a fervid Boston sports fan and married the niece of baseball Hall of Famer Carlton Fisk. At a Fenway Park news conference last fall to introduce the local franchise in the new, high-tech TGL circuit, he described the thrill of seeing the Red Sox clubhouse and giving Englishman Tyrrell Hatton a tour of the ballpark.\n\nThe Travelers presented Bradley with one of Fenway’s wooden seats at the tournament’s media day in April.\n\n“It’s one of the coolest gifts I’ve ever gotten — probably the coolest gift I’ve ever gotten in my life,” he said. “To have a seat from Fenway Park in your house is pretty spectacular.”\n\nThe Travelers will feature 22 players out of the 60 who have qualified for the Paris Olympics, including all four Americans: Scheffler, defending gold medalist Xander Schauffele, Wyndham Clark and Collin Morikawa.\n\nOthers include Ludvig Aberg (Sweden), Viktor Hovland (Norway), Hideki Matsuyama (Japan) and Britain’s Tommy Fleetwood and Matthew Fitzpatrick. Although they will be playing for their countries, the Olympics is a 72-hole, stroke-play tournament will award medals to the individuals with the low scores.\n\n“There is no team aspect of it. It would be cool if there was,” said Morikawa, who finished fourth in Tokyo, losing in a seven-man, sudden-death playoff for the bronze medal on the fourth extra hole. “Caddies are definitely going to scout the course together, they’re going to do you all the prep together, a lot of sharing information, just as if it were a Ryder Cup or Presidents Cup kind of in that sense. But when it comes down to it on Thursday, it’s our event, it’s our own individual event.”\n\nThat doesn’t mean there’s no patriotism involved.\n\n“I’m not necessarily going to go out and try to play too many practice rounds with somebody from a different country,” said Scheffler, who will be making his Olympic debut and confessed he hadn’t really thought about it. “We’re trying to go over there and earn a medal for the USA so it will probably be a closer-knit circle as we go over there.”\n\nThe rankings to determine Olympic spots were finalized with the conclusion of the U.S. Open. Countries are limited to two players, unless their third- and fourth-best players are ranked within the top 15 in the world.\n\nGolf was in the Olympics early in the last century before it was dropped from the program for more than 100 years. It returned in Rio de Janeiro in 2016, making this the third go-round.\n\nScheffler said he is excited to be a part of the Summer Games and check out other sports, including basketball and tennis. He also wanted to make a trip to the Olympic Village to watch the other athletes train.\n\n“I grew up playing a ton of sports, and so to be able to see the best in the world at their craft would be pretty special,” he said.\n\n___\n\nAP golf: https://apnews.com/hub/golf\n\n___\n\nAP Summer Olympics: https://apnews.com/hub/2024-paris-olympic-games\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCopyright 2025 The Associated Press.

Three of those women are covered in this article, while Aryna Sabalenka’s match against Daria Kasatkina is in a separate article. Who will reach the quarterfinal?\n\nHead-to-head: Rybakina 4-0 Kudermetova\n\nRybakina can complete the set against Kudermetova here. She’s beaten her on clay and hard courts in their previous meetings. This will be their first official bout on grass. The Russian has the weaponry to pose a challenge to Rybakina, but she’s been inconsistent all year, and not even a first-round upset win over Liudmila Samsonova is sufficient to convince me she’ll take down the Kazakhstani.\nPrediction: Rybakina in 2\n\n[tgdcta items=”1″ id=”170476″]\n\nHead-to-head: Pegula 1-0 Vekic\n\nPegula defeated Vekic in their only previous head-to-head match at Wimbledon two years ago. The American has been a Top 10 mainstay for a while, but she is teetering on exiting that elite coterie in the coming months if she cannot string wins together. It is pertinent to note that Pegula missed the entire European clay-court swing because of injury. Known as one of the most durable athletes on tour, it’s frustrating that injuries might jeopardize the 30-year-old’s ambitions of breaking that quarterfinal barrier at a Grand Slam. Still, I favor Pegula’s baseline discipline in overcoming the Croat in this match, but it could go either way.\nPrediction: Pegula in 3\n\nEmbed from Getty Images\n\nHead-to-head: Noskova 1-1 Jabeur\n\nIt’s Wimbledon or nothing for Ons Jabeur. Her ambitions were pretty clear after she withdrew from the Olympics ahead of schedule. The Tunisian secured a solid win over the talented Wang Xinyu in her opening match in Berlin, but she’ll need to polish up her serve, which accounted for four double faults and 48% of second serve points won. Noskova, for her part, upset home player Angelique Kerber in three sets in one of the most exciting matches of the tournament so far. This will be a good test for Jabeur as she’ll do a lot of running here. Noskova tends to go for her shots at every opportunity. Luckily, for the three-time Grand Slam finalist, she’s got an array of shots at her disposal to wreck the young Czech’s rhythm.\nPrediction: Jabeur in 2\n\nEmbed from Getty Images\n\nHead-to-head: Gauff 2-1 Alexandrova\n\nFor the second year in a row, Gauff and Alexandrova will clash in Berlin. The Russian routed the American 6-4 6-0 12 months ago, a result that had a psychological impact on Gauff’s grass-court season. She would lose her opening match at Wimbledon to Sofia Kenin. Alexandrova thrives in these conditions because she’s got that easy power that is often unmanageable. It will take an uber-confident and astute defender to keep her at arm’s length. While Gauff has those attributes, lack of game time on grass so far could haunt her again. Alexandrova has played five matches on the lawns and is better at executing her game plan.\nPrediction: Alexandrova in 3\n\n[tgdcta items=”1″ id=”180848″]\n\nMain Photo Credit: Mike Frey-USA TODAY Sports\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tNurein is CPA by profession, but he is an ardent fan of tennis.

He played for just 23 minutes before forfeiting the match while trailing Jordan Thompson 1-4.\n\nMurray later explained that he had been struggling with a back issue for a while but he felt a \"loss of power\" in his leg right before playing the match and regretted taking to the court.\n\n\"I have been struggling with my back for a while. Then, yeah, I had loss of power in my right leg. So loss of motor control, had no coordination. Yeah, couldn't move,\" Murray said of his injury. The five-time Queen's champion explained that he had been managing a back problem for a while but felt something new ahead of Wednesday's match.\n\nHe continued: \"My back's been a problem for quite a while, and it's been sore in the buildup to the tournament. It was pretty sore in my match yesterday. Yeah, it was sore through today. But I was able to manage it. I wasn't comfortable playing, but I was able to manage it. During my prematch warmup, you know, I was pretty uncomfortable, and then I walked up the stairs to go to, just before going on the court, I didn't have, like, the usual just normal strength in my right leg. It was not a usual feeling.\"\n\nThe five-time Queen's champion called the physio after three games and received a medical time-out. He continued playing but retired at the next changeover and later confessed that he never should have stepped out for the match.\n\n  Just in    Johanna Konta makes surprising Raducanu assumption after Wimbledon wildcard news  \n\nOur community members are treated to special offers, promotions, and adverts from us and our partners.

But, you know, whatever happened from when I was doing my prematch warmup, you know, to going on the match court, yeah, you know, I wish I hadn't gone on the court, to be honest,\" he explained.\n\n\"But I didn't really realise until I was kind of walking, you know, to go on the court. Yeah, in hindsight I wish I hadn't gone on there, because it was pretty awkward for everyone. Yeah, there is nothing I could do, and then there is part of you that wants to go out there and see if it gets better, you know, and maybe feel better with a bit of treatment or something, but that wasn't the case.\"\n\nMurray has previously said that he would likely stop playing this summer and retire. And he does not know whether he will be able to say farewell at Wimbledon or the Olympics after his latest setback. Asked if he could address his chances of playing at the All England Club in less than two weeks' time, he replied: \"I wouldn't know.\n\n  Don't miss...

I have never had too many issues with the right side.\n\n\"So maybe there is something that, you know, can be done between now and then, you know, to help the right side. I will get scans tomorrow and get it rechecked and see if there's anything that can be done.\"\n\nMurray was also asked whether the treatment could involve injections. \"I don't know exactly what it will be, because I don't know exactly what the problem is,\" he said. \"I just know that this is not something - I hadn't experienced that before. You know, I have had, like I said, dealing with the back pain today, yesterday, and for the last 10, 11 years of my career, but I have never experienced that before.

I got to watch it in [2018] Ryder Cup. To be able to play such amazing golf courses like we do nowadays will be such a treat.”\n\nSpeaking of treats.\n\n“I have never been to Paris, and the one thing I’m really looking forward to is the croissants probably on every corner,” Korda said. “I love bakeries and baked goods, so that’s one thing I’m really looking forward to.”\n\nUntil then, there are a couple of majors on the menu, including this week at Sahalee Country Club in Sammamish, Washington.\n\nKorda won this championship at Atlanta Athletic Club for her first major title in 2021. She claimed major No. 2 earlier this season at the Chevron Championship – one of six victories on the year.\n\nThe clear-cut world No. 1, however, is coming off back-to-back missed cuts, first at the U.S. Women’s Open and again at last week’s Meijer LPGA Classic.\n\nKorda views those as the inevitable ebbs.\n\n“I’m going to go through these situations so many times where I feel like I’m playing really well and I’ll go through a little lull where golf is the hardest thing in my life right now,” she said. “So that’s I feel like what grows myself as a person and what makes me appreciate the sport so much and makes me appreciate the wins and the highs and good shots, the crowds out there as well.”\n\nAs for this week, at a tight and tree-lined Sahalee, Korda said she still plans on playing aggressively – when warranted. Korda admitted that she doesn’t like to “practice at events,” so she spends her early-week time plotting green lights and yellow lights, knowing full well that, ultimately, she’ll have to adapt to whatever the round presents.\n\nShe had to do that a few weeks ago at Lancaster Country Club, where she made a 10 on her third hole of the U.S. Women’s Open. Korda said ahead of the Meijer event that the fight she displayed thereafter – even though she didn’t make the cut – made her more proud than any of her wins in ’24.\n\nGiven all she has accomplished, and coming off her two worst results of the season, the spotlight will be bright this week. It’s something she welcomes.\n\n“I feel like pressure is privilege, and that’s something that you’re the only one that can kind of control that. You can listen to the outside voices, but at the end of the day, when you have pressure, you can take it in a positive way that you are doing good and playing well,” Korda said.\n\n“I’m just going to stay in my bubble this week and go out and try to execute my shots, be confident in what I have. This golf course is already hard enough, and if I’m going to put more pressure on myself, then I think it’s just going to make it even harder this week.”\n\nA Division of NBCUniversal.\n\nDISCLAIMER: This site and the products offered are for entertainment purposes only, and there is no gambling offered on this site.

Scoring guard Cory Joseph is one of them.\n\nJoseph is a native of Toronto and now plays for the Indiana Pacers. Recently, Joseph got news on his potential invite to Team Canada for the Summer Olympics that had him feeling perturbed.\n\nThe news came amid Klay Thompson deciding to train with Team Bahamas amid free-agency rumors. Warriors young gun Brandin Podziemski shared the unique advice he received from NBA finalist Luka Doncic.\n\nAccording to a report from Michael Grange on Twitter, Andrew Wiggins got the nod to join Team Canada's senior team, but the ex-Warrior Joseph did not.\n\nJoseph expected to get a training camp invite according to Grange's post but did not. Joseph said he's “mad” about the snub, and he has a right to be mad about it based on the information he was given prior to it happening.\n\n“I don't want to get into all of that,” Joseph said to Sportsnet Canada, “I listened to it, and obviously I'm mad about it and feel like I have a right to be mad about it, but it is what it is. I can't remember the explanation they gave, to be honest with you.”\n\nThe 6-foot-3, 193-pound Joseph has averaged 6.9 points so far over the course of his NBA career. He played his college ball with the Texas Longhorns. Joseph has shot nearly 35 percent from 3-point land and 44 percent from the field while dishing out three assists and grabbing 2.5 rebounds per game.\n\nJoseph joined the Warriors in 2023-24 after three years with the Detroit Pistons. He became a teammate of Andrew Wiggins and averaged 2.4 points for the Dubs in his lowest-scoring campaign since the 2011-12 season.\n\nWhile Joseph never quite reached star status, he has become an explosive scoring guard who can provide instant offense off the bench or as a spot starter.\n\nFans reacted strongly to the Joseph and Wiggins news in the comments on X.\n\n“This seems – being kind – in poor taste given the history of Wiggins ducking the team and Cory doing the opposite,” one reader said. “Bad vibes already, and we're still a month away (from the Olympics),” another fan added.\n\nCanada is in Group A with Greece, Spain and Australia for the 2024 Olympic games in Paris this summer.\n\nNick Meyer is a sports writer for ClutchPoints based in the Metro Detroit area.

        "expanded content": "Taylor Fritz insists “it is possible” Novak Djokovic will be fit to play Wimbledon – based on his own experience of coming back from surgery on the same injury as tennis’ most decorated player.\n\nDjokovic is back in training following arthroscopic surgery to repair a medial meniscus he tore during a fourth-round match at the recent French Open.\n\nHis status for Wimbledon, where he is a seven-time singles champion, remains uncertain with many assuming the Serb great will pull out in order to give himself the best chance to be right for the Paris Olympics.\n\nFritz, who powered into the second round of the cinch Championships with a straight sets win over Taro Daniel, 6-3, 6-3, sustained the same injury in the same tournament in 2021.\n\nHaving left the court at Roland Garros in a wheelchair, the American underwent surgery on his right knee and won his first-round match in SW19 just 20 DAYS later.\n\nSpeaking at the Queen’s Club, Fritz revealed that Djokovic had “reached out” to him “and asked me some questions”.\n\n“I told him what it was like for me,” he said. “A lot of it comes down to the inflammation and how you react.\n\n‘Novak Djokovic’s era is not over’ – Carlos Alcaraz, Jannik Sinner sent warning by Wimbledon winner\n\n‘Novak Djokovic is more likely to play Wimbledon than not’, reveals former world No 7\n\n“It’s possible for Novak to play. It’s the exact same thing that I had and I played. Obviously, I wasn’t contending to win a title, I was just showing up to hopefully win a couple of rounds – but it is possible.”\n\nThe two-time Eastbourne champion made it through to the third round that year, having started hitting again just “five to six days” post-surgery.\n\n“When I did it I couldn’t even walk. People are different. It’s the same actual injury. It really comes down to the level of inflammation.\n\n“You pretty much have your full strength immediately. It’s more just the inflammation from the surgery. As long as you can get that down and start playing without it puffing up again, you’re actually going to be fine to play.\n\n“I was doing three-four hours of PT, a lot of icing, trying to stick to a diet which was not going to cause extra inflammation because I was real determined to play Wimbledon.\n\n“But for me it was a little bit different. If Novak goes to Wimbledon he wants to be there to win. Playing a whole tournament is different than me at the time going there.\n\n“I was going to be a low seed anyway (31). Winning a couple of rounds was a solid result for me.”\n\nWith Roger Federer retired, Rafa Nadal a confirmed absentee and serious doubts over Djokovic, world No 12 Fritz has hopes of improving on his quarter-final best in 2022.\n\nTwice an Eastbourne champion on grass, he made light work of Japanese opponent Daniel to set up a second-round match against Milos Raonic, whose 47 aces against Cam Norrie on Monday set a record for the most hit in a best-of-three set ATP Tour match.\n\nAndy Murray delivers moment of 1000-match milestone magic with epic Queen’s victory\n\nCarlos Alcaraz watching Jannik Sinner closely – despite kickstarting Queen’s title defence\n\nAsked if the 14-year drought without an American singles winner at Queen’s, since Sam Querrey in 2010, could end this week, Fritz replied: “I think there’s definitely a couple of guys who possess the ability to win.\n\n“I think all the American guys are good enough and if they’re playing well they can win,” he said.\n\nFifth seed Tommy Paul duly breezed past Sebastian Baez 6-4, 6-4, while Seb Korda disposed of Karen Khachanov also in straight sets, 7-5, 7-6.\n\n“This is my first week on grass, the first year I’ve ever not played on grass prior to this week and I’ve not done a ton of practising,” said Fritz. “But I feel I played pretty solid to the honest.\n\n“It’s about getting my timing. That’s such a big part of my game. Specifically for me, my backhand and my serve is what works for me on grass. It’s about feeling it out and getting used to it. I’ve literally never had a good result the first two weeks of a grass court season. All my good results come last two weeks.\n\n“It’s about being here and trying to find it and figure things out and make sure I’m playing my best tennis for Wimbledon.”\n\n\n                Francisco Cerundolo suffered a shock opening round loss that could be significant.             \n\n\n                \"I was thinking about my end of the road as well when we were watching Rafa having his speech.\"            \n\n\n                Fritz is guaranteed to slip down the ATP Rankings after a shock French Open exit.            \n\n\n                Chris Evert has given a brutal assessment of Novak Djokovic's French Open chances.            \n\n© Planet Sport Limited 2025 • All Rights Reserved"

She returns to the Olympics as the reigning C1 gold medallist.\n\nJessica Fox competing in Krakow.Credit: EPA\n\n“[It’s a] great lead in [for the Olympics],” she said. “You know, three World Cup events, I was actually not sure if I was going to compete in Krakow. We were sort of thinking about the plan, what would be the best plan, and in the end it was a great race to be at.”\n\nFox had won 77 World Cup medals before the event in Poland, but had claimed a kayak cross gold only once, in 2022.\n\nThe kayak cross, where four paddlers compete on the course at the same time, makes its Olympic debut in Paris.\n\nThe physical and aggressive nature of the group event makes it difficult to predict, Fox said, but the win in Poland has given her the confidence to compete in all three events in Paris. There is a possibility she could claim a trio of Games gold medals.\n\n“With the kayak [K1] and the canoe [C1], they’ve been my sort of pet events for I don’t know how many years, but the kayak cross is fresh,” she said. “It’s new for everyone, and every competition we see new athletes break through, we see different tactics come out and everyone is sort of building their confidence and their skill set in this event.\n\n“For me, I know that anything can happen in the kayak cross. Yes, I’ve won the last race, but I could also be out in the first round at the next race. It’s just so dependent on how the race unfolds, your decision-making, a little bit of luck as well.\n\n“It will be after the kayak and the canoe event in Paris, and so I think I’ll be building off my performances in those events, and also just managing the load, managing the fatigue that comes with it, but definitely coming into Paris now with those results that I’ve had and the experience that I’ve had in the kayak cross, I think I’ve definitely got more confidence.”\n\nNews, results and expert analysis from the weekend of sport sent every Monday.

Chopra had improved that mark to 89.94m at the Stockholm leg of the Diamond League in the same year.\n\n Among others, two-time world champion Anderson Peters of Grenada finished fourth with 82.58m, while 2012 Olympic champion Keshorn Walcott of Trinidad and Tobago was further down at sixth after managing to clear a season's best of 81.93m.\n\n Chopra had withdrawn from last month's Ostrava Golden Spike as a precautionary measure after he \"felt something\" in his adductor (a group of muscles located on inner thighs).\n\n He began his season at the Doha Diamond League in May, where he finished second with his final throw of 88.36m, the ninth best mark of his career.\n\n Chopra also participated at the National Federation Cup Senior Athletics Championships in Bhubaneswar, where he secured the gold medal with an underwhelming effort of 82.27m.\n\n After the Paavo Nurmi Games, Chopra will next be seen in action at the Paris Diamond League on July 7.\n\n He has opted out of the National Inter-State Athletics in Panchkula to be held from June 27 to avoid a hectic schedule ahead of the Olympics. \n\n Published - June 19, 2024 12:45 am IST\n\n\n                        athletics\n                    \n\n\n\t\t\t\t\tCopyright© 2025, THG PUBLISHING PVT LTD. or its affiliated companies.

They’re worried that soaring temperatures pose serious health risks to competitors and spectators, not to mention their performance suffering.\n\nAverage temperatures during the months when the Summer Olympics are typically held have risen by more than 3 degrees Celsius (5.4 degrees Fahrenheit) since the last time the Games were held in Paris in 1924, according to the report. Every fraction of a degree of difference can have an impact, considering even a 0.5 degree Celsius rise in core body temperature can increase a person’s heartbeat up to 10 beats per minute. In a worst-case scenario, that can lead to heat exhaustion that could worsen into heatstroke without any intervention.\n\nSummers are getting hotter with climate change, setting the stage for riskier outdoor competitions. That means there needs to be more action taken to protect athletes and their fans, advocates say, especially with the upcoming Games in Paris expected to be a scorcher.\n\n“Athletes collapsing during or after finishing competitions, remind us of this threat and the impact of climate change on sports.” \n\n“At the very least, heat impacts place athletes under a competitive disadvantage, disrupting sleep and forcing them to train earlier and earlier into the morning just to avoid the worst temperatures of the day,” J.K. Tuwei, president of Athletics Kenya, says in the report. “But it is what comes after that, if we do not act with sufficient urgency in addressing climate change, which worries me most. Incidences like athletes collapsing during or after finishing competitions, remind us of this threat and the impact of climate change on sports.” \n\nThe report was published today by the British Association for Sustainable Sport (BASIS), a nonprofit trade organization whose members include major sports clubs and venues. University of Portsmouth physiologists Mike Tipton and Jo Corbett also contributed to the report, as did nonprofit research organization Climate Central. Nearly two dozen elite athletes — ranging from track & field stars to rowers, footballers, marathon swimmers, and more — added their testimonies about how brutally hot temperatures have affected them.\n\nTennis player Marcus Daniell, who, at the 2020 Tokyo Olympics, won a Bronze medal for New Zealand in the men’s doubles, wrote about how difficult it was to stay hydrated in the heat and humidity that year. That made headaches and lethargy “normal” during the Games, he says in the report.\n\nFor me it’s like you are in the build-up to the worst part of a bad flu – shivery and weird and hot and cold. Your mind can’t focus and your mouth is disgustingly dry. And the dangerous thing is that athletes often don’t know when to stop, because we’re conditioned to push ourselves beyond limits as a rule.” \n\n... “I am worried. I have been at tournaments where there have been double digit heatstroke withdrawals in a day. This is not how sport should be played.” \n\nThe dangers are also there for swimmers diving into warming waters, British marathon swimmer Amber Keegan says in the report. World Aquatics (formerly FINA) set an upper limit for water temperature of 31 degrees Celsius (87.8 degrees Fahrenheit) for open water swimming after American athlete Fran Crippen died during a dangerously hot open water race in the UAE in 2010.\n\nPhysically, there are many impacts of extreme heat – cramp, fatigue (much more so than normal), and vomiting (which is especially bad as you’re losing the nutrition you’ve been consuming during the race). You don’t want to be using energy for cooling yourself down when you could be using it to swim faster. \n\nThat’s just the performance side, but from a safety side, if you’re struggling to think clearly, you’re not going to make a sensible decision about whether you’re overheating so much that you should be getting out. Of course, there is safety support, but at the end of the day it’s you that has to put your hand up and say “get me out.” \n\nParalympic athletes also face risks when they compete in the Paris Games in August and September. Some competitors may have conditions that affect the body’s ability to thermoregulate. One survey of more than 100 athletes at the 2020 Tokyo Paralympics found that 21 percent of them reported experiencing at least one “heat stress-related symptom.”\n\nThe report lays out a set of recommendations to make sure that athletes can be at their best and that the audience gets a good show. That includes more structured guidelines for when to postpone or cancel an event because of the heat and proactively scheduling events for cooler times of the day or at cooler locations. Built-in water and cooling breaks can also be beneficial for competitors, support staff, and fans, the report says. It even calls on sports organizations to reassess their relationships with fossil fuel companies whose greenhouse gas emissions are causing climate change. “Sponsorship may bring in much-needed finance, but the long-term cost of such partnerships must be reassessed,” the report says.\n\nIn an email to The Verge, the International Olympic Committee (IOC) said it addressed many of the issues outlined in the new report in its “consensus statement on recommendations and regulations for sport events in the heat” published in 2022. That paper encourages greater collaboration among local, national, and international sports organizations. It also says athletes should “specifically prepare for the expected environmental conditions” at an event.\n\nLocal event organizers need to be transparent about environmental risks before and during the event and provide preventative measures and medical care for heat-related illness, the paper says. The IOC also said that the local organizing committee in Paris has worked with medical experts to keep athletes safe and healthy during this year’s games, which start in late July.\n\nA weekly newsletter by David Pierce designed to tell you everything you need to download, watch, read, listen to, and explore that fits in The Verge’s universe.\n\n© 2025 Vox Media, LLC.

Current photo via Jack Spitser/Spitser Photography \n\n15 Jun 2024 – 23 Jun 2024 \n\nA lot of changes have occurred as the 9 teams in the men’s 4×200 free relay have released their line-ups for tonight’s final. \n\nSouth Africa’s Tatjana Smith joins an elite crowd as both one of three African women to win multiple Olympic Golds as well as the first swimmer since 1996 to have won both the 100 and 200 Breast. \n\nOut of over 900 athletes competing at Trials, Louisville’s Tommy Bried improved the most from seed time across his meet. \n\nIn Fukuoka, WR holder Lilly King rebounded from a poor individual performance to lead the team to gold. In Paris, now flanked by two new WR holders, King and co will look to regain the top of the Olympic podium. \n\nAmerican men were faster than Australians in 11 of 14 individual events at last month’s Olympic Trials while the women’s side was tied at 7-7.\n\nLucas Oil Stadium averaged 55.9% capacity across 17 sessions and set a record for attendance at a single session of a swim meet. \n\nOut of the 26 athletes who represented the U.S. in Doha, five went on to become first-time Olympians at U.S. Trials, including Shaine Casas and Carson Foster.\n\nFor the first time since 2008, World Records were broken at the 2024 US Olympic Swimming Trials. Today, we rank the top-10 swims of the meet.\n\nJune 17th, 2024  National, News, Previews & Recaps, U.S. Olympic Trials\n\nThe Paris Olympic roster promises to grow by a significant margin tonight with five of the six events on tonight’s schedule being finals, and two of them with relay berths up for grabs.\n\nThe night will kick off with the final of the women’s 400 IM, where Tokyo silver medalist Emma Weyant and two-time World Championship silver medalist Katie Grimes are the overwhelming favorites to claim the two American roster spots after cruising to the top two seeds this morning.\n\nNext up we’ll see the men’s 200 free, the first relay selection final of the competition which will be a must-see showdown.\n\nThe top three seeds, Luke Hobson, Kieran Smith and Drew Kibler, all broke 1:46 in the semis and figure to be the three men battling for the two available individual slots at the Games, while the rest of the field will be fighting it out for the remaining relay slots.\n\nOne man in the hunt for one of those spots is Blake Pieroni, the 28-year-old veteran who briefly retired from the sport and has come back with a newfound fire over the last year. Pieroni has a chance to qualify for his third straight Olympics if he finishes inside one of the relay spots, which will be officially the top four tonight and likely the top six at the meet’s end.\n\nTokyo Olympians Brooks Curry and Jake Mitchell, 400 free Olympic qualifier Aaron Shackell and one of the 100 free favorites, Chris Guiliano will be the other swimmers in the hunt. Shackell got into the final after winning a tightly contested swim-off on Sunday night.\n\nThe third final of the night will be the men’s 100 back, where Ryan Murphy aims to earn his third straight Olympic berth and begin his pursuit of reclaiming the gold medal he won in Rio. At the last Olympics in Tokyo, Murphy won bronze behind Russians Evgeny Rylov and Kliment Kolesnikov, who will be absent in Paris.\n\nHunter Armstrong is expected to land the other Olympic spot in the event, having placed 9th at the Games in Tokyo (missing the final by .01). Armstrong is coming into tonight’s final after avoiding a scare in the semis, having slipped off the blocks and rallying to erase an early deficit.\n\nOne of just seven men in history to have broken 52 seconds, Armstrong will be out in Lane 6 tonight after clocking 53.57 in the semis, trailing Adam Chaney (53.08) and Jack Aikins (53.23) who both set best times in the semis.\n\nThe women’s 100 breaststroke final promises to be interesting, with home crowd favorite Lilly King leading the charge after a dominant showing in the semis. Defending Olympic champion Lydia Jacoby is poised for a showdown with Kaitlyn Dobler and Emma Weber, and maybe even Kaelyn Gridley and Alex Walsh, for the second spot after all five were separated by just 45 one-hundredths in the semis.\n\nThe session’s finale will surely bring fireworks with Katie Ledecky and Claire Weinstein ready for another showdown and Simone Manuel likely having another trick up her sleeve in the women’s 200 free.\n\nManuel will have another opportunity to provide some outside smoke, as the two-time Olympian will be situated out in Lane 8 tonight after she showed some incredible front-half speed in the semis. However, it projects to be Ledecky, Weinstein and potentially Paige Madden and Erin Gemmell, in the battle for individual spots.\n\nThe other four women will be battling for the final two relay spots: Katie Grimes, Alex Shackell, Anna Peplowski and Manuel.\n\nWe’ll also see the semi-finals of the women’s 100 back tonight, and world record watch will be in effect after Regan Smith made her 57.93 prelim swim look way too easy.\n\nLucas Oil Stadium was brought to its feet over the final 100 meters of a thrilling final in the women’s 400 IM, as early leader Katie Grimes was caught by Emma Weyant and Lilla Bognar on the breaststroke leg and the three swimmers went toe to toe coming home to find out who would lock in a spot on the Paris Olympic team.\n\nAfter leading by more than three seconds at the 200, all of a sudden Grimes found herself in 3rd place at the 300-meter turn, but she didn’t panic. Grimes produced the top freestyle split in the field to pull ahead of Bognar and then locked in a stroke-for-stroke battle with Weyant, getting the best of her over the closing meters to book the win in a time of 4:35.00.\n\nAlthough the time is well shy of her lifetime and season-best times, the performance does secure Grimes a berth on the pool swimming roster for Paris after she qualified in open water last year.\n\nWeyant, the Tokyo silver medalist, had a solid performance to earn the runner-up finish and another Olympic berth, touching in 4:35.56. The swim is her fastest this season by more than three seconds.\n\nTeam Greenville’s Bognar dropped more than three seconds from her personal best, clocking 4:37.86 to place 3rd and move into 9th all-time in the girls’ 17-18 age group. The 17-year-old had previously been 4:40.97 last year at Junior Worlds.\n\nThe 29-year-old veteran Leah Smith, who dealt with a torn labrum earlier this year, moved up from 7th at the 250 to claim 4th in 4:39.87, while 14-year-old Audrey Derivaux rode the momentum from the crowd to sit in 2nd early before fading to 8th in 4:46.89—still a very impressive performance after her big drop this morning.\n\nLuke Hobson made the decisive move on the third 50 in the final of the men’s 200 freestyle, taking over the lead in a bunched up field and only extending it coming home, clocking 1:44.89 to secure his first Olympic berth.\n\nHobson, who continues the Texas Longhorn legacy of male Olympic qualifiers in the 200 free/800 free relay, was just two one-hundredths shy of his lifetime best set at the 2023 World Championships.\n\nThe race behind Hobson was a wild one, with his former Longhorn teammate Drew Kibler looking like he was tightening his grip on it as he held the lead through the 100 and still sat in 2nd at the 150. However, Notre Dame’s Chris Guiliano refused to settle for a relay spot at the Olympics, he battled home in 27.15 to overtake Kibler and snag the second individual spot in Paris in 1:45.38, a massive new personal best.\n\nKibler qualified for his second straight Olympic team by touching 3rd in 1:45.60, as did Florida’s Kieran Smith, who represented the U.S. individually three years ago in Tokyo and will return in Paris for relay duties (and the 400 free).\n\nSmith was .01 back of Kibler in 1:45.61, while Brooks Curry broke 1:46 for the first time to place 5th and likely earn a ticket to Paris (1:45.89).\n\nThe 6th and final Olympic relay spot, assuming roster numbers allow it, will go to Blake Pieroni, as the 28-year-old (likely) books a spot on his third Olympic team after briefly retiring from the sport post-Tokyo. Pieroni’s time of 1:46.09 tied his prelim swim, which was the 2nd-fastest of his career.\n\nFinals Qualifiers:\n\nAfter Katharine Berkoff made history by becoming just the fifth woman in history to break 58 seconds in the first semi of the 100 back, Regan Smith one-upped her in the next heat.\n\nSmith, who has had an air of invincibility so far this week showing incredible form, blasted her way to a time of 57.47 in the second semi, lowering the American Record of 57.51 she set last month. The swim for Smith also tied for the 4th-fastest performance ever, with Kaylee McKeown owning the three fastest and having also been 57.47 once.\n\nPrior to that, Berkoff joined the sub-58 club in 57.83, moving her up to #4 all-time as she overtakes Australia’s Mollie O’Callaghan, who just last week went under 58 for the first time at the Australian Trials in 57.88.\n\nAll-Time Performers, Women’s 100 Backstroke (LCM)\n\nJosephine Fuller and Kennedy Noble, who both broke 59 seconds for the first time this morning, produced matching 58.79s to advance to the final in a tie for 3rd, Fuller’s swim marking a new PB by .01.\n\nRyan Murphy‘s run of domestic dominance in the men’s 100 backstroke continued on Monday night, as the 28-year-old booked his ticket to a third consecutive Olympic Games with a wire-to-wire victory.\n\nMurphy and Hunter Armstrong flexed their early speed on the opening 50, distancing themselves from the field with opening splits of 25.28 and 25.36, respectively. Murphy had more to give on the back half, pulling ahead of The Magic Man and powering to the wall in a time of 52.22, tying his 10th-fastest performance ever.\n\nArmstrong had to fend off a hard-charging Jack Aikins on the second 50, but had just enough to hold on for 2nd and book a likely Olympic berth in a time of 52.72, four one-hundredths shy of his season-best 52.68.\n\nAikins, who took a redshirt year from the NCAA to focus on the Olympic Trials, followed up his 53.23 PB from the semis by rocketing to a time of 52.74, breaking 53 for the first time and narrowly missing upsetting Armstrong. Aikins was also 3rd in the 200 back at the 2023 World Trials, and based on his form, will be one to watch in that event later in the week.\n\nAdam Chaney set a best time of 53.08 last night, and after blazing out to a 25.56 opening 50, faded a tad down the stretch but still took 4th in 53.44.\n\nJust like Murphy in the men’s 100 back, Lilly King is simply undeniable in the women’s 100 breaststroke on U.S. soil.\n\nKing, who has been getting a massive pop from the Indianapolis faithful all week, jumped out to the early lead in the final and never loosened her grip, extending her advantage down the back half to touch 1st by a relatively wide margin in a time of 1:05.43.\n\nThe time dips under King’s season-best of 1:05.57 set in last night’s semis.\n\nIt was an incredible battle for 2nd, with Kaitlyn Dobler hot on King’s heels over the first 50 before Emma Weber charged through into the runner-up position. Reigning Olympic champion Lydia Jacoby started to make a big move with 25 meters to go, but it was too late, as Weber held firm to touch 2nd in 1:06.10, another best time, to likely book her ticket to her first Olympics.\n\nJacoby, who has been as fast as 1:05.74 this season, has looked maybe just a touch off in each of the three rounds thus far, and though it was a gallant effort coming home in the final, she won’t have the opportunity to defend her Olympic gold medal in Paris after placing 3rd in 1:06.37.\n\nDobler (1:06.77), Kaelyn Gridley (1:07.03) and Alex Walsh (1:07.38) all added a bit of time from the semis to place 4th, 5th and 6th, respectively.\n\nKatie Ledecky would not be denied.\n\nAfter Claire Weinstein made a move on the third 50 of the women’s 200 free, pulling nearly dead even with Ledecky, the greatest female swimmer we’ve ever seen responded by blazing down the final length in 29.87 to win comfortably.\n\nLedecky touched in 1:55.22, three one-hundredths faster than last night and a quarter of a second shy of the season-best 1:54.97 she established at the Pro Swim in San Antonio.\n\nWeinstein wasn’t the only one pushing Ledecky through the 150, as Paige Madden, who qualified alongside Ledecky earlier in the meet in the 400 free, was right there with 50 meters to go as well.\n\nThe lactic acid started to catch up to Weinstein and Madden coming home, but they held tough, with Weinstein doing just enough to touch 2nd in 1:56.18 to qualify for her first Olympic team. Weinstein clocked in at 1:55.86 in the semis, and overall has responded well after the wheels fell off during the second half of her 400 free prelim during the first session of the competition.\n\nMadden matched the personal best she set in the semis to place 3rd in 1:56.36, while Erin Gemmell moved up from 6th at the 100 to place 4th in 1:56.75, securing a spot on her first Olympic team.\n\nIn-state products Anna Peplowski (Indiana University) and Alex Shackell (Carmel Swim Club) created a big enough buffer over the first 150 that they were able to hold off Simone Manuel and Katie Grimes and place 5th and 6th, meaning they’ll be nominated to the Olympic team at the end of the meet pending roster numbers.\n\nNone of the four set new personal bests, though Peplowski’s 1:57.04 was just five one-hundredths back of hers.\n\nGrimes, coming off the 400 IM, was well back at the 150 but stormed home in 29.71, a faster closing split than Ledecky. Her final time of 1:57.33 was just shy of the PB she set in the semis (1:57.19).\n\n\n\nΔ\n\n\n\nΔ\n\nOnce the trials are over, why not do a top 20 internationally?\n\nMANAUDOU 47.90 PB?!?!?!?!?!\n\nI don’t think that is a PB.\n\nIt is\n\nit is . It was 47.98 before this swim\n\nIs Dan hicks coming at all? This other announcer sucks.  I can’t stand the way he says Paris and he fumbles over half his words.\n\nDan is there. I think he’s only doing finals.\n\nyou think Rowdy’s annoying? he’s one of the sweetest guys i’ve ever met\n\nAbout USA:- \n\n200m/400m Freestyle Events have been far from reaching the gold so far.\n\n100m freestyle events will be very promising considering the form our the swimmers.\n\n800/1500 we have been dominant for gold.\n\nI have a hard time seeing how Dressel can beat Alexy and Giuliano as their strokes are more traditional leg driven strokes and have incredible speed as well. \n\nIt is incredible that Dressel was able to go sub 47 with his upper body driven stroke. But that will do well for him in the 50 free and 100 fly. Also, I hope Dressel start is fully back today. Where he starts a body length ahead of everyone else.\n\nThe Women’s 400im were much slower than I expected.\n\nAgreed.  I think perhaps the trials pressure may have gotten to them.  I would be willing to bet they will both be considerably quicker in Paris and hopefully one or both winds up on the podium.\n\ni wonder if Grimes is trying to conserve some energy because if her lengthy program.   That’s my excuse for her lol\n\nThe men’s and women’s freestyle events have been very underwhelming so far .\n\nMen’s 200 free was about as good as anyone should realistically expect. Think the 100s for both today will be good.\n\nAustralia is going to win womens 4×200 by a video game margin.\n\nthat was obvious before Trials began\n\nGreat W 4IM. But had to put the youtube video on silent. Does RG annoy you Americans too?\n\nYou have no idea\n\nHe speculates too much in his commentary it’s frustrating. It really bothered me when he said Smith would go a WR in the 100 back semis seconds before she had her start. I never believed in jinxes till that moment\n\nI don’t believe in jinxes even after that moment.\n\nYes, that was daft! I simply find his voice so irritating.\n\nJames swam five years at Laurentian University in Sudbury, Ontario, specializing in the 200 free, back and IM.

In 2003 in July and August – the same time as the upcoming Olympics will be held – a record heatwave resulted in more than 14,000 excess deaths in France.\n\nThe French forecaster Météo France has already predicted warmer than normal conditions for May to July across the country. There is a 70% chance it will be hotter than usual, the forecaster said.\n\nIn a “consensus statement”, the International Olympic Committee proposed a suite of mitigation measures to safeguard the health of athletes. But it recognised extreme heat as a growing problem for sport around the world.\n\n“Unfortunately, the level of environmental heat stress experienced by elite athletes will continue to rise in the coming years due to a combination of the increased prevalence, intensity and duration of bouts of … heat waves that are occurring due to climate change, and sport globalisation leading to more competitions being organised in extremely hot climates.”\n\nHot and/or humid conditions make it harder for athletes to regulate their core body temperature, impairing physical performance, particularly in endurance events.\n\nFor athletes competing in extreme heat, the health risks run from sunburn and heat cramps, through to heat exhaustion or even collapse from heatstroke, which is life-threatening.\n\nSign up to Australia Sport\n\nGet a daily roundup of the latest sports news, features and comment from our Australian sports desk\n\nafter newsletter promotion\n\nThe Australian racewalker Rhydian Cowley will compete at his third Olympics in Paris and said he was concerned for the health, and the lives, of athletes.\n\n“We already know that extreme heat is a silent killer among the general population, and that even with prior preparation and intervention, it can still be risky for athletes to compete in.\n\n“So, absolutely, I’m concerned that extreme heat in competition could threaten the lives of athletes.”\n\nThe Australian javelin thrower Kelsey-Lee Barber, an Olympic bronze medallist in Tokyo and two-time world champion, said she was concerned at how quickly competing in extreme temperatures had become a reality.\n\n“While we have adapted to the likelihood of competing in extreme heat, the bigger picture of why we are experiencing it isn’t being addressed: it’s just been accepted and planned for. I think there should be more awareness around the bigger picture when it comes to rising temperatures.”\n\nSebastian Coe, the president of World Athletics – and a two-time Olympic gold medallist – said the consequences of global heating on athletes “can be varied and wide-ranging”, from smaller performance-impacting issues like sleep disruption and last minute changes to event timings, to severe health impacts such as heat related stress and injury.\n\n“While global temperatures continue to rise, climate change should increasingly be viewed as an existential threat to sport. We are in a race against time. And this is one race that we simply cannot afford to lose.”"

Zii Jia needs to believe in himself if he hopes to succeed,” said James.\n\n“He also has to work with his coach (Wong Tat Meng) and come up with the best strategies against his potential opponents.\n\n“Whether he wins the gold or not is a different matter but he needs to prepare himself as best as he can and be ready when the competition starts.”\n\nJames has also urged Zii Jia to build on his positive showings of late.\n\n“It’s good that he won the Australian tourney as this will boost his confidence. His win also ensures that he will remain in the top eight in the world rankings and will be seeded in the Olympics,” said James.\n\n“There’s definitely some improvement in his game under Tat Meng’s guidance. He has done his homework well and pushed Zii Jia to a different level.\n\n“But there’s still work to be done as the Olympics is a completely different tournament.\n\n“Many top players will be there like Axelsen and China’s world No. 1 Shi Yuqi. Both did not play in Australia.\n\n“I believe these two players will be Zii Jia toughest opponents in Paris. There are also others who could play the role of spoilers,” added James.\n\nYuqi is one of the favourites for the gold after overtaking Axelsen in the top of the rankings following back-to-back title wins in the Singapore and Indonesian Open earlier this month.\n\nThe Dane might not be at his dominant best this year but will also not give up on his crown without a fight.\n\nWhile anticipating a tough task for Zii Jia, James has urged the Kedahan to focus on his recovery after an exhausting past few weeks and to avoid injuries leading up to the Olympics.\n\n“Zii Jia has played quite a lot of tournaments and needs to recover well now,” said James.\n\n“He must be very careful during these few weeks, avoid injuries and maintain his fitness. It’s important to be at full strength both physically and mentally to do well in the Olympics.”\n\nBesides Zii Jia, Malaysia will also be represented in the showpiece event by Aaron Chia-Soh Wooi Yik (men’s doubles), Pearly Tan-M. Thinaah (women’s doubles), Chen Tang Jie-Toh Ee Wei (mixed doubles) and Goh Jin Wei (women’s singles).\n\nThe badminton competition in the Olympics will be held from July 27-August 5.\n\nThank you for your report!\n\nCopyright © 1995-\n            \n\n Star Media Group Berhad [197101000523 (10894-D)]\n\nBest viewed on Chrome browsers.\n\n\n\nWe would love to keep you posted on the latest promotion.

        "expanded content": "With Rafael Nadal and Carlos Alcaraz playing doubles together at the Paris Olympics, here are the 13 most exciting doubles pairs of all time\n\nThe impending doubles combination of Rafael Nadal and Carlos Alcaraz at the Paris Olympic Games is a dream for tennis fans around the world. \n\nThis is not the first time in tennis history that two tennis stars have played doubles together. Whether in an official match or in an exhibition, here are some of the most exciting doubles pairs of all time.\n\nSeeing two players who have won a Grand Slam and have already reached world No 1 team up in doubles is something extremely rare. \n\nThis is what we will experience at Roland-Garros this summer during the Paris Olympic Games. A tennis legend, Rafael Nadal, and one of today’s stars, Carlos Alcaraz, will try to win the gold medal next August.\n\nThe two players, obviously more than at home on clay, are favourites for the men’s doubles. Their partnership is made even more exciting because Rafael Nadal is Carlos Alcaraz’s idol. Seeing them play the Olympic Games together feels like a real passing-of-the-torch moment.\n\nThis is undoubtedly THE doubles combination that made the entire tennis world cry the most. \n\nFor the final match of Roger Federer‘s career, he called on his biggest rival Rafael Nadal to play a doubles match at the Laver Cup 2022 in London. Very complicit, the two men first offered the British public smiles before tears appeared at the end of the match against the winning pair, Sock/Tiafoe.\n\nSeeing Federer and Nadal shoulder-to-shoulder on the bench, with tears in their eyes, is an image that will remain in tennis legend.\n\nIf Andy Murray had already created a surprise by announcing that he was going to play the men’s doubles alongside Pierre-Hugues Herbert at Wimbledon in 2019, the Briton placed a cherry on the cake by revealing the name of his mixed doubles partner: Serena Williams. The country’s hero, twice winner in London alongside a legend of women’s tennis, seven-time winner on the lawn of the All England Croquet and Lawn Tennis Club.\n\nThis unique and exciting duo reached the round of 16 of the mixed doubles at Wimbledon. The pair lost to Bruno Soares and Nicole Melichar.\n\nFour legends on a tennis court for an exceptional doubles match! In 2010, Roger Federer, Pete Sampras, Rafael Nadal and Andre Agassi played an exhibition match in Indian Wells to raise funds for victims of the Haiti earthquake.\n\nThe four players, who at the time represented 44 Grand Slam titles, put on a show in front of nearly 15,000 spectators. The Sampras/Federer pair won the match eight games to six against the Agassi/Nadal duo.\n\nTheir relationship has never been the same as that between the Swiss and Rafael Nadal, but Roger Federer and Novak Djokovic playing doubles together was an unprecedented and exceptional event. The two teamed up at the 2018 Laver Cup in Chicago. This one-off resulted in a defeat against the pair Kevin Anderson / Jack Sock.\n\nDuring the match, Novak Djokovic notably sent a forehand straight into the back of his Swiss partner, who obviously took it with a smile.\n\nThe rivalry between the two men was still far from being what it is currently, but history will remember that Rafael Nadal and Novak Djokovic played together in doubles. The two legends teamed up at the Masters 1000 in Toronto in 2010, at a time when the Serbian had only one Grand Slam title to his name!\n\nThe unprecedented pair was beaten in their first match at the Toronto Masters by Canadians Vasek Pospisil and Milos Raonic, 5-7, 6-3, 10-8. This is the first time that the world No 1 and No 2 played together in doubles since Americans Jimmy Connors and Arthur Ashe teamed up in 1976.\n\nFriends outside of tennis, Novak Djokovic and Andy Murray decided in 2011 to team up in doubles to compete in the Masters 1000 in Miami. Respectively No 2 and No 5 in the world and candidates for victory in the singles event, the two players still took the gamble of playing the doubles in Florida.\n\nThe Serbian and the Briton lost in the first round against the Stakhovsky/Youzhny pair. Novak Djokovic consoled himself by winning the singles tournament for the second time in his career.\n\nAfter retiring from singles at the end of the 1992 season, John McEnroe still made a few appearances on the circuit, notably in 1999 when he lined up in mixed doubles at Wimbledon with Steffi Graf (a first since 1979 for the American).The team, made up of two tennis legends, reached the semi-finals. The German player then withdrew to concentrate on the singles, which did not necessarily please the American:\n\n“For one of the few times in my life, I was left speechless. I sat there in silence for five minutes, then I started to get angry. It was the end of the day and there were only two people left next to me in the locker room. \n\n“I turned to them and said, “Can you believe what that b***** did to me? These two people were Andre Agassi and his trainer, Brad Gilbert. It turned out that I didn’t know a lot at the time,” McEnroe wrote in his book You Cannot Be Serious.\n\nWhen two former world No 1s team up to play a team competition, there’s a lot of noise! During the 1992 Hopman Cup, Germany presented a dream team with Boris Becker and Steffi Graf, two immense tennis stars.\n\nAfter winning the quarter-final against France, without playing the doubles, the two Germans lost in the semi-final against the Czech Republic. At 1-1 after the singles, the two nations were decided in the only doubles contested together by Boris Becker and Steffi Graf. The latter lost 6-4, 6-4 against the Novacek/Sukova pair.\n\n“We played mixed doubles at the Hopman Cup in Australia a looooong time ago. Steffi was great and I was terrible!” Becker had also commented in an Instagram story.\n\nNothing better than one of the most popular couples in tennis history to inaugurate the new roof of the Center Court at Wimbledon. Andre Agassi and Steffi Graf therefore teamed up on the London turf in 2009, 10 years after their meeting, against the pair Kim Clijsters / Tim Henman. This is one of the couple’s rare appearances on a tennis court.\n\nThen-world No 2 Roger Federer and tennis legend Björn Borg played a single doubles match together in an exhibition in Kuala Lumpur. The Basel-native and Swede were beaten 7-5 by the McEnroe/Blake pair.\n\nAfter playing against each other 14 times on the ATP Tour (7-7), John McEnroe and Bjorn Borg teamed up for an exceptional doubles match at the 2012 Optima Open in Belgium.\n\nYes, The Rocket and Ice Borg were paired in doubles at the US Open in 1975. Rod Laver and Bjorn Borg made it to the third round, where they lost to the Dent/Lloyd pair. History will also remember that the 1975 US Open was the scene of the only Grand Slam clash between Borg and Laver, with a victory for the Swede.\n\n\n\nUnited Kingdom\n\nSpain\n\n\n\nSpain\n\n\n\nUnited States\n\n\n\nYour email address will not be published.

Please try again later.\n\nThis was published 11 months ago\n\nAdd articles to your saved list and come back to them any time.\n\nThe morning after Australia’s swimmers officially booked their ticket to the Paris Olympics, the country’s stars turned their attention to an NFL stadium in Indianapolis, some 15,000 kilometres away.\n\nHow will Australia’s swimmers perform in Paris in July and August? Is this really, as Ian Thorpe declared on Saturday night, shaping up as the greatest Australian Olympic swimming team in history?\n\nWe’ll know a lot more by the end of the week. After six nights of strong performances at the Brisbane Aquatic Centre, the USA’s swimming trials began with a bang on Sunday morning, Australian time.\n\nUSA Swimming has transformed Lucas Oil Stadium, the home of the Indianapolis Colts, into a swimming arena for the week, with capacity for 30,000 fans.\n\nGretchen Walsh is a superstar in the US college system but almost unrecognisable in Australia. On Sunday, she broke the women’s 100m butterfly world record by 0.3 seconds … in a semi-final.\n\nLucas Oil Stadium in Indianapolis is hosting the US swimming trials. Credit: AP\n\nMinutes later, Ariarne Titmus’ long-time rival and the undisputed greatest female swimmer of all time, Katie Ledecky, clocked 3:58.35 to win the women’s 400m freestyle final. The time was almost three seconds slower than what Titmus managed in Brisbane on Monday night.\n\nBut after months of debate and previews, the swimming world is this week going to get a decent gauge of who is going to reign in Paris.\n\nAs it stands, there are six individual events on the Paris swimming program where Australia has the No.1 ranked swimmer, based on times this year (so far). There are also major gold medal chances in relays, notably in the women’s 4x100m and 4x200m freestyle. Of course, a lot can change, but here’s an early form guide.\n\nAriarne Titmus \n\nEverything is going perfectly for Titmus, who has put herself in position to make it back-to-back gold medals in both the 200m and 400m freestyle. No female swimmer has managed that accomplishment. Titmus (3:55.44) was 0.08 seconds off her world record in the 400m freestyle and much quicker than Canada’s Summer McIntosh and Ledecky have been this year. The 400m freestyle in Paris has been billed as the “Race of the Century” but, on current form, it could be the Australians to lose. Nothing is a given in sport and that’s why Titmus’s coach, Dean Boxall, will have all sorts of tricks up his sleeve to keep his athlete primed. She will also contest the 800m freestyle, and is a medal chance.\n\nKaylee McKeown\n\nTitmus might be more of a household name, but McKeown is just as dominant. The three-time Olympic gold medallist is the fastest in the world this year in the three individual events she will contest in Paris: the 100m and 200m backstroke, and the 200m individual medley. No woman has completed the 100m and 200m backstroke double at back-to-back Olympics. Shane Gould (Munich 1972) is the only Australian to win three individual gold medals at the same Olympics. If there’s one swimmer to keep an eye on this week in Indianapolis, it’s backstroker Regan Smith, who is McKeown’s biggest rival. Smith came second to McKeown in all three backstroke events (50m, 100m and 200m) at last year’s world championships in Fukuoka but has been posting sharp times and will be wanting to spoil the Australian’s party. \n\nCam McEvoy \n\nThe 30-year-old, who effectively quit swimming after the Tokyo Olympics, is the first Australian male swimmer to make it to a fourth Games. A 100m freestyle specialist in years gone by, McEvoy has revolutionised his training program and is focusing on the 50m freestyle. Australia has never won a medal in this event. His rise was capped with a maiden individual world championship gold medal last year. McEvoy clocked 21.35 at trials but has swum 21.13 this year. His gold medal-winning time of 21.06 last year was an Australian record. It was the biggest winning margin in a men’s 50m freestyle final in world championship history.\n\nSam Short and Elijah Winnington\n\nShort won gold (400m freestyle), silver (800m freestyle) and bronze (1500m freestyle) at last year’s world championships but was below his best at trials due to illness. He’s been battling gastro, to the point he pulled out of the 1500m (he will still be allowed to race it in Paris). Short’s 400m and 800m times in Japan last year put him in gold medal contention. He believes he can break the 400m and 1500m freestyle world records in Paris. The question is whether he can get back to full health and perform when it matters. Elijah Winnington owns the second-fastest times in the 400m and 800m this year.\n\nMollie O’Callaghan\n\nO’Callaghan beat her own world record in the 200m freestyle at the Olympic trials but was beaten by Titmus. O’Callaghan took that loss to heart – she was spotted crying in the arms of coach Dean Boxall after – and will use it as motivation. If everything goes to plan, she and Titmus can go 1-2 in that event, it just depends on what order. O’Callaghan won gold in the 100m freestyle at last year’s world championships. That time (52.16) was quicker than Marrit Steenbergen’s world best this year (52.26).\n\nMollie O’Callaghan and Ariarne Titmus after their epic 200m freestyle final.Credit: Getty\n\nKyle Chalmers \n\nA gold medallist in Rio in 2016, Chalmers was pipped by American Caeleb Dressel in the 100m freestyle in Tokyo. His time of 47.75 at trials wasn’t anything special, but he’s been battling a bad back. China’s Pan Zhanle set a new world record earlier this year (46.8 seconds). Chalmers’ best is 47.08 and it’s likely he’ll have to go faster if he wants another gold medal.\n\nZac Stubblety-Cook \n\nWon gold in the 200m breaststroke in Tokyo and had excellent success after that. Lost his world record to Qin Haiyang last year. Stubblety-Cook’s time of 2:07.4 in Brisbane was well outside his personal best (and former world record) of 2:05.95. He’s third-ranked in the world this year. \n\n44 athletes selected (pool and open water). \n\nDebut (22): Iona Anderson, Ben Armbruster, Jaclyn Barclay Jack Cartwright, Abbey Connor, Elizabeth Dekkers, Jenna Forrester, Maximillian Giuliani, Shayna Jack, Lani Pallister, Alexandria Perkins, Jamie Perkins, William Petric, Ella Ramsay, Samuel Short, Flynn Southam, Kai Taylor, Samuel Williamson, Bradley Woodward, Olivia Wunsch, William Yang, Joshua Yong. \n\n2nd Olympics (13): Isaac Cooper, Meg Harris, Zac Incerti, Se-Bom Lee, Kaylee McKeown, Thomas Neill, Mollie O’Callaghan, Brendon Smith, Jenna Strauch, Zac Stubblety-Cook, Matthew Temple, Ariarne Titmus, Elijah Winnington. \n\n3rd Olympics (3): Kyle Chalmers, Emma McKeon, Brianna Throssell. \n\n4th Olympics (2): Bronte Campbell, Cameron McEvoy.\n\nThere are plenty of other medal chances and some youngsters coming through who could make waves in Paris. For the women, Shayna Jack is an outside chance in the 50m freestyle, while Lizzy Dekkers, a world championship silver medallist, is flying under the radar in the women’s 200m butterfly. Max Giuliani, the second-fastest Australian 200m freestyler behind Ian Thorpe, would need a big personal best for a medal in that race, while Matt Temple isn’t out of the running for a podium finish in the 100m butterfly.\n\nAustralia’s best gold medal haul in the pool is the nine they won three years ago in Tokyo.\n\nSports news, results and expert commentary.

The competition allows for a number of overage players to also feature.\n\nThere was speculation over Mbappe's place as he departed Paris Saint-Germain this summer for pastures new. The 25-year-old confirmed his move to the Bernabeu earlier this month.\n\nMbappe joined the Champions League-winners on a free transfer from PSG but certainly didn't come cheap. The France superstar signed a five-year contract worth £12.8million per season, with the prospect of an eye-watering signing-on fee worth between £103m-£128m to be included.\n\nLa Liga's newest star was not critical of his club in the slightest when asked about seeing his bid to play in the Olympics blocked. \"My club's position is very clear and I understand that,\" Mbappe said. \"I will not be there. I understand my club's position as I am a newcomer. I hope we win the Games.\"\n\nMbappe will lead France's hopes at Euro 2024. Finding success is the only thing on his mind this summer and he looked to put fitness concerns to one side.\n\n\"I'm ready to win, it's more of a mental issue,\" he said. \"My head is perfect, now let's see how my legs are.\"\n\nMbappe's role for the tournament is not a certain one. Les Bleus get their tournament underway on Monday against Austria in a tricky group with Netherlands and Poland.\n\nThe Dutch side came away with a 2-1 win thanks to goals from Cody Gakpo and Wout Weghorst. That will put France under pressure to at least match the scoreline.\n\nMbappe is prepared to be flexible to do so. \"I have spoken with the coach and he has told me that I can play in several positions this time and that it is not a problem. It doesn't matter where I play because I am ready to play and adapt,\" Mbappe said.\n\nJoin our new WhatsApp community and receive your daily dose of Mirror Football content.

While her nearest competitors surrounded the UVA athlete in the pool, the electronic support has been just as resounding. Walsh, who lowered the WR by three-tenths of a second, said after the race that she “…was probably the most shocked out of the people I know”\n\nAlso, in that interview, in response to the question, “How does it feel to break a world record held by Sarah Sjostrom?” Walsh responded by saying\n\nIt’s insane. I mean, she’s an amazing athlete and swimmer and role model for me, so to even be, like, in the same sentence as her is insane already, so it’s truly a dream come true. \n\nThe former World Record holder, who held the record from 2009 to 2012 and then took it back from Dana Vollmer in 2015 posted on Instagram the following message.\n\n \n\n \n\nA post shared by Sarah Sjöström 🏊🏻‍♀️🇸🇪🥇 (@sarahsjostrom)\n\n\n\nSjostrom also responded to fans who were hopeful that Sjostrom would re-take the record at some point in the future with a playful message: “That ain’t gonna happen”.\n\n\n\nSince placing 7th in the 100 fly at the 2020 Toky Olympics, Sjostrom has moved away from the event in international competition and put more emphasis on the 50 free and 50 fly, of which she holds the world record in both.\n\nSjostrom and Walsh squared off three times last summer. In the 50 free and 50 fly individually as well as in the women’s 4×100 free relay. The Swede got the best of Walsh in all of the races, as she both the 50s and outsplit Walsh in the relay by 1.82 seconds. The pair occupied the podium together in the 50 fly, as Walsh won the bronze medal .69 seconds behind the World Record holder, Sjostrom.\n\nFormer American and World Record Holder Dana Vollmer appeared to be in the pool as a screenshot of her Instagram story, shows her filming the swim.\n\n\n\nOne of her UVA coaches, Tyler Fenwick, posted a funny message tying her results to the Lucas Oil Stadium venue.\n\n \n\n \n\nA post shared by Tyler Fenwick (@uvacoachfenwick)\n\n\n\n\n\nΔ\n\n\n\nΔ\n\nDuring the current century, the Mount Rushmore of women’s swimming:\n\nWorld Aquatics Championships\nIndividual medalists\nHosszu – 9 G, 1 S, 5 B\nLedecky – 16 G, 3 S, 0 B\nSjostrom – 14 G, 6 S, 3 B\n\nSarah is the coolest swimmer in the world.\n\nFunny that Gretchen was shocked.

Get features like\n\nAfter a couple of unfruitful days at archery’s Final Olympic Qualifier, India secured a women's recurve individual quota for the Paris Olympics as young Bhajan Kaur grabbed the gold medal in the tournament held in Antalya, Turkey on Sunday.\n\nEight Olympic spots were up for grabs in the individual event that awarded only one quota per country. Ankita Bhakat also made the quarter-finals minutes before Kaur did. While the former exited there, the 18-year-old from Haryana went all the way and beat\n\ntop-seeded Mobina Fallah of Iran 6-2 (28-26, 29-29, 29-26, 29-29) for the gold medal. Kaur and Bhakat were part of the Indian trio that won the Hangzhou Asian Games women’s team recurve bronze last year. \"Kaur Bhajan takes GOLD and QUOTA ticket for India at the Final Olympic Qualifier,\" World Archery wrote on X.\n\nThis was India's second Paris quota in archery after a long wait; Dhiraj Bommadevara had earned the men's individual berth at the Asian Continental Qualifier Tournament last November. The men's and women's teams that could not lock their spot from this final qualification tournament are likely to sneak in through world rankings.\n\nStunned by lower-ranked Ukraine in the Round of 16 of the team outing, the onus was on the Indian women to step up and get the job done in the individual event by at least making the quarters and securing the quota.\n\nDeepika Kumari, seeded second, however had a horror start as she fluffed a 4-0 lead to go down 4-6 to Yaylagul Ramazanova of Azerbaijan, who was seeded a lowly 31st.\n\nThat shocker from the experienced archer left it to Bhakat and Kaur to deliver, and they did. Bhakat, a product of the Tata Archery Academy in Jamshedpur, went past Israel's Shelley Hilton 6-4 in the second round, Mikaella Moshe, also of Israel, 7-3 in the third before blanking Gabrielle Monica Bidaure of Philippines 6-0.\n\nMinutes later, the teenaged Kaur followed her compatriot into the quarters beating Slovenian Urska Cavic 7-3. She earlier beat Urantungalag Bishindee of Mongolia 6-2 in the third round.\n\nWhile Bhakat exited in the last eight stage going down to Fallah 6-4, Kaur kicked on. Seeded third, she swept past 27th seed Wioleta Myszor of Poland 6-0 in the quarters and 10th seeded Moldovian Alexandra Mirca 6-2 in the semis.\n\nThat brought her up against the top seed and the young Indian remained clinical against the Iranian. Kaur shot a 10 and a couple of 9s to take the opening set in which the Iranian littered an 8. Fallah then tidied herself shooting a couple of 10s but an X (closer to the centre) by Kaur made the difference in splitting the second set 29-29.\n\nThe youngster remained clinical in the third, shooting quality 9s and 10s while the top seed was undone by an awry 7. Up 5-1, all Kaur needed was another point and she got it by maintaining her composure off the final shot. Chasing Fallah's high 29 in the fourth set, Kaur's 10 landed in the middle of the target as she signed off with a levelled set, the gold medal and a wide smile.\n\n\n\n"

She has been on the receiving end of hard fouls and has struggled at times during her rookie season. She was also left off the USA roster for the Olympics.\n\nThe decision not to take her to Paris has led to a significant amount of racist, sexist and homophobic comments online from people purporting to defend Clark, who is white, in a league where the majority of players are Black and many are gay.\n\n“People should not be using my name to push those agendas. It’s disappointing. It’s not acceptable,” Clark said last week. “... Treating every single woman in this league with the same amount of respect, I think, it’s just a basic human thing that everybody should do.”\n\nClark has said publicly that she tries to avoid social media due to the pressure of being in the national spotlight at a young age.\n\n“Honestly, I feel like I talk to the media more than I get to talk to my own family, which is – No, I’m being dead serious – which is really kind of sad in a way,” Clark said in May. “It’s a lot for somebody that’s 22 years old. It can be tough at times. Getting off social media, that’s been the healthiest thing.”\n\nClark has consistently tried to distance herself from off-the-court controversies, saying her focus is solely on basketball. But she has also been criticized for not using her platform to speak out on issues and for avoiding controversial topics.\n\nWilliams said she recognized the pressure on Clark and that she also stays away from her social channels.\n\n“I love that she tries to stay grounded,” Williams said. “She says she doesn’t look at her social [media]. I get it. I don’t either. I think it’s so important to just continue to do what she’s doing. No matter what other people do. Hopefully she’ll continue to do what she’s doing.”\n\nSpeaking at ahead of the series that will air on ESPN+ on 10 July, Williams also detailed the treatment she received as a teenager in the tennis world.\n\n“I was bullied. Things that I had to go through, people would be canceled for saying now,” Williams said. “My position in growing up, as a teenager, I kind of had to be guarded to kind of stay sane. Just [getting] so much press and doing everything I was doing and traveling the globe every year. It was every week. It was a grind.”"

Archive photo via Jack Spitser/Spitser Photography \n\n15 Jun 2024 – 23 Jun 2024 \n\nA lot of changes have occurred as the 9 teams in the men’s 4×200 free relay have released their line-ups for tonight’s final. \n\nSouth Africa’s Tatjana Smith joins an elite crowd as both one of three African women to win multiple Olympic Golds as well as the first swimmer since 1996 to have won both the 100 and 200 Breast. \n\nOut of over 900 athletes competing at Trials, Louisville’s Tommy Bried improved the most from seed time across his meet. \n\nIn Fukuoka, WR holder Lilly King rebounded from a poor individual performance to lead the team to gold. In Paris, now flanked by two new WR holders, King and co will look to regain the top of the Olympic podium. \n\nAmerican men were faster than Australians in 11 of 14 individual events at last month’s Olympic Trials while the women’s side was tied at 7-7.\n\nLucas Oil Stadium averaged 55.9% capacity across 17 sessions and set a record for attendance at a single session of a swim meet. \n\nOut of the 26 athletes who represented the U.S. in Doha, five went on to become first-time Olympians at U.S. Trials, including Shaine Casas and Carson Foster.\n\nFor the first time since 2008, World Records were broken at the 2024 US Olympic Swimming Trials. Today, we rank the top-10 swims of the meet.\n\nJune 15th, 2024  National, News, Previews & Recaps, U.S. Olympic Trials\n\nThe first (up to) four names will be named to the U.S. Olympic Team tonight after the finals of the men’s and 400 freestyle. There will also be some jostling for position in the 100 stroke events. The order of events is as follows:\n\nTo no one’s surprise, Katie Ledecky claimed the top seed in the women’s 400 free. Though she’s no longer as dominant as she once was in this event on the international stage, domestically her reign is still unchallenged. No other American woman has been under the 4:00-barrier before, and in prelims Ledecky made it a career 29th career outing with a 3:59.99. As we’ve gotten used to throughout her career, she’s as close to a lock as we’ll see to make her fourth Olympic team.\n\nBehind Ledecky, Paige Madden is in position to qualify for her second Olympics. She was 1.81-seconds off her best time this morning (4:04.83), recently set at the NOVA Speedo Grand Challenge. Her time of 4:03.02 from May crushed her best from Tokyo, where she swam 4:03.98 in the heats. If Madden can carry that momentum into the final tonight, she could challenge the 4:00-barrier.\n\nThere were a flurry of scratches in the top eight, with Erin Gemmell and Katie Grimes both bowing out. That adds veteran Leah Smith into the final heat, who seems to have signaled retirement is eminent. Smith is also fighting back from a torn labrum suffered last January, but she is the second fastest American woman in history.\n\nThose scratches also gave 16-year-old Kayla Han a finals berth. This is Han’s second Olympic Trials, though her first experience was a scaled back affair as USA Swimming split the meet into two waves to accommodate Covid-19 prevention measures. There, she finished 9th in the 400 IM. She shaved a bit of time off her entry time, which was also her personal best, to sneak under 4:10 for the first time (4:09.96). Regardless of if she makes the Olympic team or not, Han looks to be on the cusp of a great meet.\n\nJillian Cox had a strong swim in the final heat, finishing second to Ledecky (4:06.35). She shaved 25-hundredths of a second off her best time from last summer, a good sign heading into tonight.\n\nAurora Roghair (4:09.67) and Anna Peplowski (4:09.87) were also in that final heat. Both have been a touch faster in their careers.\n\nRounding out the field for tonight is Madi Mintenko, who shaved just over half of a second off her entry time to qualify 4th. Mintenko is the defending World Junior silver medalist, so she has some experience performing under pressure.\n\nAfter a record-breaking NCAA season, the question on everyone’s minds regarding Gretchen Walsh was: but can she do it in long course?\n\nThat question was answered in the second circle-seeded heat with a resounding 55.94. Despite having the slowest reaction time of her heat (0.75), Walsh rocketed out to 26.22 at the 50 and didn’t look back, extending her lead down the stretch to become the #6 performer of all time.\n\nThe next question we should ask: how much faster can she go? At NCAAs, Walsh got faster at night in each of her individual events, and while it’s just semis tonight, the pressure is on to secure a top eight finish and the chance to vie for an Olympic berth.\n\nAmerican record-holder Torri Huske was also firing this morning, though to slightly lower heights. She clocked 56.26 to win the final heat and was actually out faster than Walsh to the 50 (26.17). She’s been exactly three-tenths faster than Walsh and has already shown 55-form this season, but we’ll have to wait until finals to see them head-to-head.\n\nRegan Smith had the fastest back-half of the field to pull past her new Longhorn teammates Kelly Pash (57.66) and Emma Sticklen (58.22). She’s seeded 3rd (56.68) after prelims. She’s shown rapid improvement in this event over the past year and will be one to watch throughout the rounds as she seems the most likely swimmer to disrupt the Walsh-Huske party.\n\nThere will be a strong Longhorn presence in semis tonight, as Smith, Pash (5th), Sticklen (9th), Olivia Bray (58.67, 14th), and Dakota Luther (58.73, 16th) will all feature tonight.\n\nThe second qualifier from Tokyo, Claire Curzan, got a little lost in the wash of 58-point swims (58.17, 7th). As she’s turned her attention towards the backstroke events her butterfly has lagged behind, but she does hold a season best of 56.64 from her silver medal performance in Doha. If she’s in 56 form here, she should be a lock for the final.\n\nThere’s a trio of junior swimmers who will swim in their first Olympic Trials semifinal tonight. Of the three, Alex Shackell is seeded the highest after hitting a PB in the heats (57.07, 4th). Shackell got her first senior team experience last summer in Fukuoka where she anchored the U.S.’s silver medal 800 freestyle relay. She climbed from 9th to 8th all-time and is knocking at the door of a 56-second swim, a time only seven other American women have ever achieved.\n\nLeah Shackley (58.47, 11th) and Charlotte Crush (58.68, 15th) are the other two junior swimmers in for tonight. Crush hit a best time while Shackley has been as fast as 57.98 in her career.\n\nBeata Nelson is 6th out of prelims with a best time (57.68), after dipping under 58 for the first time earlier this May. If she can find another drop again, she’ll be in a strong position to make the second Olympic Trials final of her career.\n\nThere are now three (3) (that’s three) men under the Olympic Qualifying Standard in the men’s 400 freestyle, something we fretted about in our event previews and has been on everyone’s mind since watching Jake Mitchell punch his Tokyo ticket in a time trial.\n\nTo some fans surprise, it wasn’t Kieran Smith or David Johnston who swam under the stiff 3:46.78 standard this morning, but a new up-and-comer: Luke Whitlock.\n\nWhitlock, an 18-year-old Florida commit, rocketed himself up to #2 17-18 all time with a huge personal best in the heats. Last May he clocked 3:49.10 for a new personal best, and in the final heat he lowered that time to 3:46.42. He beat Johnston to the touch (3:47.17) and will have the center lane tonight.\n\nHis swim should light a fire under the rest of the field, particularly Smith who is lurking back in 6th (3:48.25). Smith earned a bronze medal in this event in Tokyo, but hasn’t earned an individual international medal since, at least not in long course.\n\nJake Mitchell, Aaron Shackell, and Jake Magahey finished just four-tenths apart, taking the 3rd, 4th, and 5th spots out of prelims. All three men have been faster in their careers, and if they’re all on form it could be a dogfight to the finish.\n\nBobby Finke was 8th out of prelims. While he’s better known for his prowess in the longer distance events, we’ve seen him play spoiler before. He was just off his best time (3:48.63), and that was without his signature closing 50. He was “only” 29.14 to the wall, but he just might lack the raw speed to really move up the rankings.\n\nWe almost had the exact field picked in our preview, but Drew Kibler’s scratch last night played spoiler. Instead, the eighth man in the final is Daniel Matheson, another distance specialist like Finke who is swimming down to this distance. He shaved a couple tenths off his entry time to qualify in 7th (3:48.57).\n\nThe state of men’s sprint breaststroke will not only be important for the U.S.’s individual medal chances, but also for the 400 medley relay, where they are the defending Olympic champions and world record holders.\n\nNic Fink led of a quintet of 59-point swims this morning in the men’s 100 breaststroke (59.24). He’s right about where he was in 2021 (59.21) before scorching a then-PB 58.50 in semis. He settled for 3rd in the final, but has since picked up Worlds bronze, silver, and finally gold in Doha.\n\nThe American record holder Michael Andrew made it through to semis in 59.72, the last of the 59-points. There’s been some questions regarding Andrew’s form as of late, but after news broke that he dropped the 200 IM from his schedule we can be slightly more assured that he’s all-in on the shorter events. He was much faster in prelims three years ago, but added time in finals.\n\nThe rest of the 59s come from Josh Matheny (59.34), Charlie Swanson (59.44), and Jake Foster (59.59).\n\nLiam Bell and Brian Benzing had big prelims swims to break 1:01 for the first time in their careers. If they can ride that momentum tonight, they could also dip in barrier-breaking territory.\n\nKeep an eye out for Danny Kovac, who won a swim-off for 16th this morning. After clocking 1:00.80 in the heats, already a big PB, he found another drop to 1:00.47.\n\nIn between, the field is tightly bunched, but there’s the talent present to get a lot faster.\n\n\n\nΔ\n\n\n\nΔ\n\nAlso, crossing my fingers big time for hometown fav Beata Nelson!\n\nIs Regan going to contest the 100 fly all the way to finals? I kind of thought she’d just see what she could put up in prelims and then scratch, but didn’t look like it. I feel like her demanding schedule + relay obligations does not leave room for another event…\n\nPredictions for this evening :\nW 100 fly semis: not predicting any records at all, but I think both huske and Walsh will be within 0.3\nM 400 free final: Johnston, Smith, Mitchell and  Shackell will fight for the two spots. winning time 345\nW 400 free final: KL 3.58 Madden 4.01 rest over 404\nM 100 breast semis:  we should see a couple of 58s\n\nFINKE??? WHITLOCK????\n\nBold to leave the only guy under the OQT in the 4 free out of the top 4. Whitlock is on fire\n\nSo does the actual finals start at 7:45 but NBC is on a 15 min delay?\n\nFinals start today at 8pm but may vary to as early as 7:45 on other days depending on NBC’s broadcasting schedule accommodations\n\nWarning!\n\nRowdy Gaines reaction time alert.  Good thing Gretchen can’t hear the broadcast.\n\nI’m hoping Katie Ledecky can break the U.S. Open Record (3:57.94) in the W 400 FR tonight.\n\nFWIW: ONLY ONE MAN, Cal’s Jack Meehan, swam his prelim 400 free in a slower time than Katie Ledecky. \n\nLedecky went 3:59.99, and Meehan went 4:03.8.\n\n(Meehan is NOT the son of the Stanford women’s coach.)\n\nThanks for being convicted twice in one year, Donald!\n\n34 COUNTS\n\nLET THAT SINK IN\n\nFinals are 8:45 pm ??\n\n7:45 eastern\n\nSession starts with womens 100 fly semi 803 pm EDT\n\nMore from Laura RosadoSee All\n\nSubscribe to our newsletter and receive our latest updates!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSubscribe to SwimSwam Magazine!\n\n\nSubscribe\n\n\n© 2025 Swim Swam Partners, LLC.

Thoughts are with Alan, Janet and all the family’. \n\nAhead of Italy's Euro 2024 opener against Albania, the Match of the Day host took a moment during the live broadcast to issue another emotional message to his former colleague.\n\n'It's been a tough week for everyone associated with Match of the Day,' the former England forward said. \n\nGary Lineker paid tribute to Liverpool legend Alan Hansen (pictured) who is seriously ill in hospital  \n\nWe're all thinking of Alan Hansen ❤️@GaryLineker @AlanShearer pic.twitter.com/pUGxIgcFVD\n\nLineker (pictured), who worked with Hansen on Match of the Day for several years, took a moment during BBC's broadcast of Italy vs Albania to send his well wishes to his old colleague\n\nTurning to his colleague Alan Shearer, he added: 'The news that Alan Hansen was seriously ill in hospital shocked us all, didn't it Alan?' \n\nThe former Newcastle striker responded: 'Oh absolutely. We are great friends with Al, we know his character we know he's a fighter, we know how tough he is. \n\nShearer added: 'We're thinking of you big man and we're with you, we're hoping and we're praying for you.' \n\nLineker added: 'Everyone at Match of the Day sends love and thoughts to Janet, Lucy and Adam and the grand children. \n\n'To use an analogy of Alan's favourite pasttime, golf, he might be three down with four to play, but if anyone can come back from it, it's Alan. I've never known a more competitive person in my life. We're all with you big Al.'\n\nHansen began his footballing career with Sauchie in Scotland before moving on to play for Partick Thistle in 1973. He'd join Liverpool in 1977 and would go on to make 614 appearances for the Merseyside outfit, returning 14 goals and 19 assists before retiring in 1991. \n\nThe 69-year-old rejected the offer of going into management before pursuing a career in broadcasting, where he would take up positions with Sky and BBC Radio 5 Live. \n\nHe'd subsequently join up with BBC Match of the Day as a co-host in 1992 before leaving the show in 2014 having covered 16 FA Cup finals, six World Cups, five European Championshpis and one Olympics with the BBC.  \n\nAlan Shearer (pictured) cut an emotional figure as he sent his well wishes to the former Scotland player\n\nHansen (right) enjoyed a glittering career with Liverpool winning the first division eight times \n\nThe Scotsman (pictured) would retire in 1991 and take up a career in broadcasting, co-hosting match of the day \n\nHansen (right) would work alongside Lineker (left) on BBC Match of the Day for several years\n\nLiverpool football club sent their well wishes to Hansen, writing on the club's website: 'The thoughts and support of everyone at Liverpool FC are with our legendary former captain Alan Hansen, who is currently seriously ill in hospital.'\n\n'A defender of the utmost elegance, Hansen's outstanding raft of honours across a 14-year spell with the Reds – he joined from Partick Thistle in 1977 – included eight league titles, three European Cups, two FA Cups and three League Cups.' \n\n'\"Jockey\", as he was known by teammates, is in the top 10 for all-time appearances for the club having played 620 matches, and the Scottish centre-back also served as Liverpool skipper for four seasons.\n\n'The club is currently in contact with Alan's family to provide our support at this difficult time, and our thoughts, wishes and hopes are with Alan and all of the Hansen family.'\n\n\n\t    Share what you think\n          \n\nThe comments below have been moderated in advance.\n\n\n      The views expressed in the contents above are those of our users and do not necessarily reflect the views of MailOnline.\n    \n\nWe are no longer accepting comments on this article.\n\nPublished by Associated Newspapers Ltd\n\nPart of the Daily Mail, The Mail on Sunday & Metro Media Group"

Please try again later.\n\nThis was published 11 months ago\n\nAdd articles to your saved list and come back to them any time.\n\nJarryd Hayne has spent a sum estimated to be well over $3 million on legal fees to clear his name and win his freedom. Some sources have told me the figure is closer to $4 million when you include potential lost football earnings.\n\nThe former NRL star, who during the week had his convictions for sexual assault quashed, has sold property he had earmarked to provide an income after his retirement from football to finance his court battles.\n\nIt’s no surprise, then, that those around him have suggested he will try and recoup some of those losses by selling his story to the media. But it would be a surprise if any of the networks were willing to fork out big bucks in the current climate.\n\nOf far more concern is the mental toll the saga has taken on the families of Hayne and the young woman involved, and that should not be forgotten amid the sight of Hayne walking free from jail.\n\nHayne was so confident of his release that it seemed almost a fait accompli even before the NSW Court of Criminal Appeal found in his favour. Some of his former teammates had confidently been telling people in the days leading up to the verdict that Hayne would be released. Even the family of the woman who accused Hayne of rape were prepared for his release.\n\nThe woman’s sister has been active on social media in recent days. She wrote: “Regardless of the Hayne outcome on Wednesday 12 June, I stand with a strong brave woman who put herself through hell to see it doesn’t happen again.”\n\nJarryd Hayne leaves prison after his successful appeal.Credit: Steven Siewert\n\nAfter the verdict, she took to social media in a big way, publishing a string of posts expressing her disappointment with the outcome and highlighting details from the case.\n\nAnd she reposted another that read: “To the unnamed survivor. You should not have to live through this. One trial is traumatic enough. Three is unimaginable. Four would be beyond comprehension. You have an entire community of survivors thinking of you and we are in your corner.”\n\nIt’s worth remembering that the woman was reluctant to come forward at first because she doubted whether she had the strength to go through the legal process. Her life has been turned upside down in the six years since that night in 2018, while Hayne’s image and legacy as a footballer has been tarnished forever.\n\nHayne was the standout player of his generation but will now be remembered for this case. I will never forget the last time I saw him before the charges were laid. He had just completed a sprint session in Centennial Park under the guidance of Roger Fabri and I interviewed him about his desire to play another season in the NRL, possibly for the Dragons, having failed to win a new deal at Parramatta.\n\nIt was an awkward situation for me, as by then I was aware that the family of the woman wanted to take action but at that point were still trying to decide how to go about it. The woman’s brother-in-law contacted me to ask my advice on how to deal with the matter, and instead of reporting the story I put them in touch with the NRL and the integrity officer of the time, Karyn Murphy. The family asked me not to divulge our conversation about the events of the night in Newcastle which led to Hayne’s arrest and subsequent legal battle. But once the police were involved and other reporters were starting to get hold of the information, I had no choice other than to break the story.\n\nMy distinct memory is of watching Hayne meet his partner and child as they were picking him up after the Centennial Park training session, thinking that it would quite possibly be one of his last moments of peace with those he loved before the story became public.\n\nThe story of Brandon Smith’s off-field battles is one he may or may not choose to tell one day.\n\nIt likely won’t be in this column, as we have called Smith out in the past. However nothing we have reported about Smith has been motivated by animosity.\n\nQuite the opposite, in fact. He is the kind of player and personality the game needs.\n\nWhat’s fair to say is that Smith’s issues are genuine and that he will need to get on top of them if he is to fulfil his obvious talent as a professional rugby league player. We hope Smith returns to the people he has sought out before for help.\n\nIt’s unclear whether the Roosters knew exactly what they were buying when they paid huge dollars to sign Smith from the Melbourne Storm.\n\nWhat is certain is that the Storm were not unhappy to see the back of him. Not because he was an unpopular person, just that he was too much hard work. This column reported at the time that coach Craig Bellamy and others at the Storm were happy to see the back of Smith, and was duly slammed by News Corp, who published a puff piece saying how wrong we were and quoting Smith in a free kick at this columnist.\n\nBrandon Smith is the kind of player and personality the game needs.Credit: Getty Images\n\nIt was a poorly researched and flimsy article. A call or two to well-placed sources at Melbourne would have confirmed everything we wrote.\n\nPerhaps the Roosters are kicking themselves for not doing their due diligence. To the club’s credit, they have done plenty behind the scenes to try and get Smith on the right path. Partly to help him as a person, but also because they have made a huge financial investment in the player.\n\nSmith has a big future as a media performer, but that should still be some way down the track at the conclusion of a long and successful top-flight playing career.\n\nWhether or not that is as a Rooster remains to be seen. The club can lose patience with players quickly, but can fall in love with them again just as easily. Everything is in Smith’s hands, but without a significant redirection of his life, it’s looking like this will be his last year at the Roosters.\n\nAt the heart of Lachlan Galvin’s issues with Wests Tigers has been his agent’s intense dislike of coach Benji Marshall.\n\nThe Tigers say they don’t know where it stems from, but they acknowledge it as a fact.\n\nWhat they want cleared up is the suggestion the club was in any way irresponsible by “making” the 18-year-old play with a broken hand. The club walked Galvin’s family through the situation with his injury during the week, and by the end of the meeting they were satisfied with the explanation.\n\nIt’s been widely reported Galvin’s agent, Isaac Moses, asked the Tigers for a fourth time to release his client. What is not as well known is that, as a schoolboy, Galvin had agreed to join the Tigers’ rivals, Canterbury.\n\nLachlan Galvin after the Tigers’ win against the Sharks in March.Credit: Getty Images\n\nGalvin was previously managed by Moses’ employee Adam Brame, who had agreed terms with the Bulldogs for Galvin. Moses was suspended as an agent at the time, but took over negotiations when he got his licence back.\n\nHe wouldn’t let Galvin sign with the Dogs and instead negotiated a deal with then Tigers recruitment manager Warren McDonnell – against the advice of many in the game. Now, with Galvin having signed a lucrative contract at the Tigers until the end of 2026, Moses wants the Tigers to release him so he can move elsewhere.\n\nDamien Cook deserves to leave South Sydney with his head held high after years of sterling service. But there have been strong suggestions the club was prepared to let him go immediately. It would be wrong for a player of his standing to depart in such a way.\n\nThis has been denied by Cook’s agent, Mario Tartak, who is likely to rev-up talks with Souths and the Dragons this week. There is no better person in the game than Cook. He is a quality human and tremendous player. Let’s hope he leaves Souths in a positive fashion and kicks on at his new club.\n\nBlake Wilson, the Bulldogs’ two-try hero against Parramatta on Monday, probably should’ve been playing for the Eels after they made a significant play for him last year.\n\nThere was more money on the table, plus a shot at the fullback position, where Wilson certainly has the ability to play. When he was deciding which club to join, he took a call from Parramatta captain Clint Gutherson, who said he’d move out of fullback to make way for the rising star. Wilson felt a sense of loyalty to the Bulldogs, who plucked him out of the Sunshine Coast where he was in the Storm’s feeder system and gave him a chance on a train-and-trial deal. He signed on for about $50,000 and, since that time, has proved to be a first-grader of real worth.\n\nMeanwhile, there were lovely scenes at the end of Monday’s game when Dogs captain Stephen Crichton gave his boots and headgear to the two boys from the Abdallah family. The looks on the lads’ faces were priceless. The family was hit by tragedy in 2020 when three of their children and a niece were killed by a drunk driver as they walked to get ice-cream.\n\nThe Matildas are darlings of the Australian sporting public, but they aren’t as well loved by a media finding them increasingly frustrating to deal with.\n\nAn example during the week: the Matildas were announcing $15 million in federal government funding for the 2026 Asian Cup, which Australia is hosting. Sports Minister Anika Wells and Football Australia CEO James Johnson were in attendance at The Rocks, as were three Matildas – only one of whom, Cortnee Vine, is in the 18-player squad for the Paris Olympics.\n\nFA officials said Vine was not available to answer questions from the media because she was tired after playing two friendlies the previous week.\n\nThat kind of thing is par for the course, according to those who have to cover them on a regular basis. The Matildas are flying high now but, if they hit the skids, there are plenty of media types who won’t forget their treatment.\n\nSports news, results and expert commentary.

But for Pierre Rabadan, the Olympics have been going since 2020.\n\nBack then, the former pro rugby player was spearheading Paris's preparations for the Games.\n\nNow, he's the city's deputy mayor, and putting the finishing touches on a sporting and cultural opus he believes will transform the French capital and leave a glittering legacy.\n\nHe also has a warning for Brisbane, set to host the Olympics and Paralympics in 2032: \"Don't wait.\"\n\n\"Eight years might seem far away, but it's tomorrow,\" Mr Rabadan says. \"You have to manage things now.\"\n\nThat's ominous for the Sunshine State, where a surprise change of premier, as well as bickering over money and stadiums, have already waylaid preparations.\n\nBy March, things had become so chaotic the Queensland government was denying claims it sought advice about the cost of cancelling the Olympics altogether.\n\nOrganisers are hoping temporary venues like this will help keep the Paris Olympics budget under control. (ABC News: Andrew Greaves)\n\nBrisbane's winning bid initially sparked excitement. But for some, it didn't last.\n\nNow, there are questions about whether the city has signed itself up for an expensive extravagance that doesn't just overstate its economic and social benefits but tears at the very fabric of the communities it's imposed upon.\n\nParis has tossed aside the once-invariable Olympic rule book to create what organisers hope will be a more sustainable, cost-effective games.\n\nFor instance, the opening ceremony will be held along the river Seine, rather than a gleaming, purpose-built stadium.\n\nIn fact, only two new permanent venues have been constructed for Paris 2024, with spectators instead set to take over the city's iconic parks and buildings in swathes of temporary stands.\n\nParis Deputy Mayor Pierre Rabadan says he knew there would be some blacklash over the Games. (Reuters: Stephanie Lecocq)\n\n\"Organisationally, it's more difficult, probably, but it's really exciting,\" Mr Rabadan says.\n\nThe deputy mayor is adamant Paris' Olympics budget of €8 billion ($13 billion) won't be exceeded, although the final bill is yet to be calculated.\n\nThat's more expensive than initial estimates, but cheaper than what it's cost previous hosts Tokyo ($19.6 billion), Rio ($19.7 billion), Beijing ($58 billion) and London ($16.8 billion).\n\nA promising start, perhaps, but the road to the finish line remains full of hurdles.\n\nParis is preparing to welcome an influx of tourists ahead of the Games. (ABC News: Andrew Greaves)\n\nAboubakar doesn't want to be on the streets.\n\nHe arrived in Paris from Guinea earlier this year, but has found life tough, and says the Olympics haven't helped.\n\nInitially, he was living in tents in different spots around the city.\n\n\"Each time, we are made to leave,\" he says. \"We don't know what to do.\"\n\nHe's part of a group of about 200 young migrants — predominantly from East Africa — who've been occupying the Maison des Métallos cultural space in central Paris since early April.\n\nYoung migrants have been occupying the Maison des Métallos in Paris since April. (ABC News: Andrew Greaves)\n\nCity Hall, which runs the venue, issued a press release calling for federal authorities to help find more permanent accommodation for the group.\n\nProgramming was cancelled. The city says it's the seventh time such the building has been occupied since December.\n\nLast month, the migrants — most of whom are undocumented and say they are children — were served eviction notices. They're due to be removed next week.\n\nAuthorities in Paris have been moving on homeless populations in the lead-up to the games. Ten temporary relocation centres have been established in other cities.\n\n\"We were invited here [Maison des Métallos] to come and have coffee. Once we got in, we said we won't go out because there are a lot of young people sleeping outside that don't have a home,\" Aboubakar says.\n\n\"We don't want that. We want to be accommodated. We don't want to sleep on the street. That's why we're here.\"\n\nAboubakar says the young migrants inside the Maison des Métallos will fight their eviction.

Busses were waiting to take the former residents out of the city.\n\nPaul Alauzy, from the humanitarian organisation Médecins du Monde, has been tracking evictions around Paris ahead of the Olympics.\n\nHe claims a program of \"social cleansing\" is being enforced in the capital.\n\n\"The words can be harsh, but that's really what's happening,\" he says.\n\n\"This year every tent city, every slum, every squat, everybody that lives or relies on the streets is being kicked out or pushed away from Paris.\"\n\nPolice have been ordering rough sleepers to move in the lead-up to the Paris Olympics. (Reuters: Abdul Saboor)\n\nMaison des Métallos, where the young migrants have been sheltering for more than two months, is set to host a Japanese cultural installation during the Olympics.\n\nConditions inside are basic.

[We want to] use the Games to create a social legacy,\" he says, arguing the issue transcends Olympic preparations.\n\n\"My problem is we have homeless all year. That's the real problem.\"\n\nYoung migrants occupying the Maison des Métallos in Paris have been drawing to pass the time. (ABC News: Andrew Greaves)\n\nOn the streets of Saint-Denis, in Paris' north, people have mixed views on the Olympics.\n\nThe densely populated working-class borough — with its sprawling housing estates and large immigrant communities — has struggled with violent crime for centuries.\n\nIt's also home to France's national stadium, where most of the athletics and para-athletics events will be held, and a new indoor arena which was built for the Games.\n\nAuthorities are hoping the Olympics have a transformative effect on the suburb.

(ABC News: Andrew Greaves)\n\nMr Rabadan says the Olympics have accelerated several projects in the city, including building masses of new bike paths and cleaning up the Seine, in which some events, like the open-water swimming and triathlon, will be held.\n\nParis, which is roughly 200 kilometres inland, will soon have three \"beaches\", where people can swim.\n\nThe city's mayor, Anne Hidalgo, as well as President Emmanuel Macron, are next Sunday planning to have a dip to prove their efforts have been a success.\n\nBut even that massive environmental project, which has cost an estimated $2.3 billion, is not universally popular.\n\nUpstream, some people say they're planning to \"take a shit in the Seine\" as part of an anti-Olympics protest to disrupt the photo opportunity.\n\nRoad closures and construction have become the norm in Paris ahead of the Olympics. (Reuters: Benoit Tessier)\n\nThe deputy mayor concedes life for Parisians over the course of the Games could be \"difficult\".\n\nBut Mr Rabadan is philosophical about the backlash, saying he was warned there'd be negativity as the event got closer.\n\nHe accepts some Parisians will leave while the Olympics and Paralympics are on.\n\n\"I don't think it's a good option, but if they want to do it, they can,\" he says.\n\n\"The people who are here will probably have memories for the rest of their life.\"\n\nParisiens Noé Daudin (left) and Sépi Sognoko are planning to leave the city while the Games are on. (ABC News: Andrew Greaves)\n\nBrisbane was selected to stage the 2032 Games after a new process effectively created a one-city race.\n\nBut serious bids to host the world's biggest event have been dwindling for years.\n\nThe International Olympic Committee (IOC) convinced Los Angeles — which had also been eying the 2024 Games — to abandon its proposal in exchange for getting them in 2028.\n\nAs powerbrokers search for new avenues to secure the Olympics' future, activists are promising to find ways to disrupt it.\n\nDespite what its name suggests, the NOlympics LA coalition is broader than just Los Angeles. They're looking at Brisbane, and beyond, highlighting issues such as homelessness and heavy-handed law enforcement as their main concerns about the Games.\n\n\"We're not the kind of campaign that wants to just push the Olympics into another city,\" Gigi Droesh, one of the group's organisers, says.\n\n\"We don't think that there can be guardrails put on it. We don't want a kinder Olympics. We want the Olympics to stop happening everywhere. We want the IOC to stop existing. We don't we don't want any Olympics ever.\"\n\nThis arena in Saint-Denis is one of just two new venues being built for the Olympics. (ABC News: Andrew Greaves)\n\nThis year marks the third time Paris has held the Olympics. When the city first staged them in 1900, the modern Games were in their infancy. It was, by most accounts, a bit of a disaster.\n\nFew people had heard of them, and even fewer knew they were happening in the city.\n\nOn competing in the last Paris Games, Australian sprinter Stanley Rowley reportedly described the events as \"an insult\" to the concept of competition, and said entrants treated them as \"a huge joke\".\n\nOver the subsequent decades, they became a global behemoth, and among the pinnacles of human sporting endeavour.\n\nAustralians have celebrated a myriad of Olympic moments. Who could forget Cathy Freeman's nation-galvanising 400-metre gold in Sydney almost a quarter of a century ago?\n\nNow, however, the Games' future is arguably less certain than ever.\n\nPaul Alauzy, from the humanitarian organisation Médecins du Monde, is concerned about the social impact of the Olympics. (ABC News: Andrew Greaves)\n\nOrganisers in Paris believe they're crafting something historic this time, and hope their efforts will bring people together.\n\nThat's something they don't seem to have managed to do quite yet.\n\nMr Alauzy accepts the Paris Games will go ahead, but he now sees them as an opportunity to make a point.\n\nAnd that's something he wants disillusioned people in the Queensland capital to keep in mind over the next eight years.\n\n\"Brisbane, you're going to be able to show the world what's really happening in your city and in your country,\" he says.\n\n\"So you need to seize that and you need to mobilise. It's a really a David and Goliath story … but you need to prepare now because it's a huge machine, and it's hard to stop.\"\n\nSpectators watch a breakdancing competition in Paris, ahead of the Olympics next month.

More info\n\n In the wake of online abuse targeted at emerging sprint star Rhasidat Adeleke, Taoiseach Simon Harris has offered his support, encouraging her to disregard the haters. Adeleke, from Tallaght, proved herself as one of the brightest prospects in the sporting world after bagging three medals at this week's European Championship. \n\nA smashing performance saw the 21 year old clinch gold in the mixed 4x400m relay, silver in the women's 4x400m relay and another silver in the individual 400m, reports the Irish Mirror. Yet despite these successes, she was left in tears by harsh comments on social media, as revealed by her American coach Edrick Floreal on Q102s Weekend Sports Breakfast.\n\n Eager to offer his consolation, the Taoiseach took to Twitter and penned: \"Rhasidat Adeleke is not only a world-class champion, she is a world-class person. You have inspired a nation this week, especially young girls and boys.\n\n \"You are class, so please do not let online cowards bring you down. You are Ireland and Ireland could not be more proud of you.\"\n\nAlready holding six national records under her belt, Adeleke is definitely someone to watch out for in the imminent Paris Olympics.\n\nFor all the latest news from Dublin and surrounding areas visit our homepage.\n\nJoin our Dublin Live breaking news service on WhatsApp. Click this link to receive your daily dose of Dublin Live content.

All he had to do was make the cut to move past Jorge Campillo and earn a spot in the Olympics this summer in Paris.\n\n“Unless someone like Eugenio Chacarra wins,” Puig said earlier in the week.\n\nWatch NBC6 free wherever you are\n\nHe wasn't thinking about Sergio Garcia, who also is still in the mix at the U.S. Open. With golf and the world ranking, there's always more math involved than adding scores on a card.\n\nThe U.S. Open is the final week before the Official World Golf Ranking is used to determine the 60-man field for the men's competition at Le Golf National.\n\nGet local news you need to know to start your day with NBC 6's News Headlines newsletter.\n\nEach country is allowed two players, with a maximum of four if they all are ranked among the top 15 in the world.\n\nMasters champion Scottie Scheffler and PGA champion Xander Schauffele, who won Olympic gold in Japan three years ago, already are assured a spot. Still to be determined is the other two players from the United States, along with tight races in Canada and possibly South Korea.\n\nWyndham Clark has held down the No. 3 spot for the Americans for much of the year, and he still looks to be fairly safe.\n\nCollin Morikawa, who lost in a playoff for the bronze medal in Tokyo, seized control of the fourth spot when he was runner-up at the Memorial last week. Morikawa already has played in the final group of two majors this year.\n\nPatrick Cantlay, however, emerged as a contender with rounds of 65-71 that left him one shot out of the lead going into the weekend. A victory would move him ahead of Clark in the world ranking, and a two-way tie for second might be enough to bump Morikawa.\n\nMorikawa still has the golf ball in his hand, even after a 74 on Friday left him in a tie for 51st going into the final two days at Pinehurst.\n\nCantlay has never spoken much about the Olympics, saying at the start of the year only that “any time you have the opportunity to represent your country, it's important.” He was in a similar situation for the Tokyo Games, falling short in the final qualifying week at Torrey Pines.\n\nWinning a major was his top priority at Pinehurst.\n\nNick Taylor sewed up his spot in the Olympics by winning the Phoenix Open in early February, and it has been a revolving door of candidates ever since — Corey Conners, Adam Hadwin, Dallas winner Taylor Pendrith and Mackenzie Hughes.\n\nHadwin finished third at the Memorial and leaped past Conners for the No. 2 spot for Canada.\n\nBut then Hadwin missed the cut at the U.S. Open. Connors, with a game built for tough majors like the U.S. Open because of his supreme iron play, put together rounds of 69-70 and was tied for ninth going into the weekend.\n\nPendrith, who was 1-over par through two rounds at Pinehurst, also was still alive. Hadwin can only watch to see how it unfolds.\n\nConners would need to finish 11th alone at the U.S. Open to move past Hadwin. Pendrith would need at least a two-way tie for third (and then that might depend on what Conners does).\n\nTom Kim and Byeong Hun An appear to have the two spots locked up, especially with Sungjae Im missing the cut.\n\nThe only player who can bump out An — who missed the cut — is Si Woo Kim, though he would need a two-way tie for third. Kim was seven shots out of that position going into Saturday.\n\nAs for Im, he isn't likely to lose any sleep over this. Im (and Si Woo Kim) won the team gold in the Asian Games last year in China, and that made them exempt from mandatory military service. For South Korean men, that's better than gold.\n\n\n\nTeam Britain is set with Tommy Fleetwood and Matt Fitzpatrick after Justin Rose and Robert MacIntyre missed the cut.\n\nMost curious is Tyrrell Hatton, who is only four spots behind Fitzpatrick in the world ranking.\n\nHatton was tied for ninth through 36 holes at Pinehurst. Something in the top 10 might have been enough to move past Fitzpatrick. Something a little better might have given Britain three players because Hatton currently is at No. 20.\n\nHowever, Hatton decided to remove his name from Olympic qualifying and is no longer eligible.\n\nAdam Scott has never liked the idea of golf in the Olympics and removed his name from consideration, leaving Jason Day and Min Woo Lee virtually locked up for Australia.\n\nFormer British Open champion Cameron Smith is a long shot. He started the weekend at 3 over and would need to finish third to have any chance of bumping Lee.\n\nHere's where it pays to play for LIV Golf (beyond the obvious).\n\nThe Saudi-backed league does not get world ranking points. That actually helped Puig when he compiled a series of good finishes on the Asian Tour because the ranking formula is points earned divided by tournaments played over a two-year period.\n\nPuig has a minimum divisor of 40. So does Garcia, another LIV player. Garcia could finish second at the U.S. Open and that would be enough to move past Puig.\n\nIt's a long shot. And nothing is settled until the scores are in Sunday, the world ranking is published and the National Olympic Committee from each country certifies who's going."

In such cases, these quota places will be reallocated to athletes from other NOCs in accordance with the qualification system of the respective IF.\n\nIt would appear that there could be open spots at the following weights.\n\nMen's Freestyle: 57, 74, 97, 125\n\nGreco-Roman: 60, 77, 87, 130\n\nWomen's Freestyle: 50, 57\n\nThis would suggest that Kamal Bey has a shot at competing in Paris, as he would be the next person in line to qualify due to finishing in fourth place at the last chance World Olympic Qualifier, and because there may be an open spot in the bracket with Russia not having an eligible athlete at 77kg. \n\nBelow is a list of athletes who had qualified for the Olympics and were the presumed starters. Athletes that are not eligible at this moment are underlined. Weights that were qualified but have no eligible athletes are also underlined. \n\nRussia\n\nMen's Freestyle 57kg: Zaur Uguev\n\nMen's Freestyle 65kg: Shamil Mamedov\n\nMen's Freestyle 74kg: Zaurbek Sidakov\n\nMen's Freestyle 86kg: Artur Naifonov\n\nMen's Freestyle 97kg: Abdulrashid Sadulaev\n\nMen's Freestyle 125kg: Abdulla Kurbanov\n\nGreco-Roman 60kg: Sadyk Lalaev\n\nGreco-Roman 77kg: Sergey Kutuzov\n\nGreco-Roman 87kg: Milad Alirzaev\n\nGreco-Roman 97kg: Artur Sargisian\n\nGreco-Roman 130kg: Sergey Semenov\n\nWomen's Freestyle 50kg: Nadezhda Sokolova\n\nWomen's Freestyle 53kg: Natalya Malysheva\n\nWomen's Freestyle 57kg: Olga Khoroshavtseva\n\nWomen's Freestyle 62kg: Alina Kasabieva\n\nWomen's Freestyle 68kg: Olga Khoroshavtseva\n\nBelarus\n\nMen's Freestyle 57kg: Aryan Tsiutryn\n\nMen's Freestyle 74kg: Mahamedkhabib Kadzimahamedau\n\nMen's Freestyle 97kg: Aliaksandr Hushtyn\n\nMen's Freestyle 125kg: Dzianis Khramiankou\n\nGreco-Roman 87kg: Kiryl Maskevich\n\nGreco-Roman 97kg: Abubakar Khaslakhanau\n\nGreco-Roman 130kg: Dzmitri Zarubski\n\nWomen's Freestyle 53kg: Viyaleta Rebikava\n\nWomen's Freestyle 57kg: Iryna Kurachkina\n\nWomen's Freestyle 62kg: Krystsina Sazykina\n\nThe process for how eligible substitutes were selected was not described in the IOC press release, nor was it specified if it would be possible for Russia or Belarus to submit new candidates for weight classes that they qualified for Paris but have no eligible athletes listed. \n\nIt should also be noted that the press release from the IOC does not label any athletes as ineligible, they only provide a list of athletes who are eligible. This could potentially leave the door open for athletes not listed to be ruled eligible at a later date. \n\nHowever, there is nothing to indicate that the IOC plans on doing this, and the start of the Olympics is less than two months away. \n\nRussian Wrestling Federation President Mikhail Mamiashvili had no comment on the situation and stated that they are waiting for more clarification from the IOC. \n\nTags:\n\n Get the most important Wrestling stories delivered straight to your inbox. \n\n©2006 - Present FloSports, Inc.

(AP) — David Puig of Spain knew the score even before he teed off in the U.S. Open at Pinehurst No. 2. All he had to do was make the cut to move past Jorge Campillo and earn a spot in the Olympics this summer in Paris.\n\n“Unless someone like Eugenio Chacarra wins,” Puig said earlier in the week.\n\nHe wasn’t thinking about Sergio Garcia, who also is still in the mix at the U.S. Open. With golf and the world ranking, there’s always more math involved than adding scores on a card.\n\nThe U.S. Open is the final week before the Official World Golf Ranking is used to determine the 60-man field for the men’s competition at Le Golf National.\n\nEach country is allowed two players, with a maximum of four if they all are ranked among the top 15 in the world.\n\nMasters champion Scottie Scheffler and PGA champion Xander Schauffele, who won Olympic gold in Japan three years ago, already are assured a spot. Still to be determined is the other two players from the United States, along with tight races in Canada and possibly South Korea.\n\n\n\n\nWyndham Clark has held down the No. 3 spot for the Americans for much of the year, and he still looks to be fairly safe.\n\nCollin Morikawa, who lost in a playoff for the bronze medal in Tokyo, seized control of the fourth spot when he was runner-up at the Memorial last week. Morikawa already has played in the final group of two majors this year.\n\nPatrick Cantlay, however, emerged as a contender with rounds of 65-71 that left him one shot out of the lead going into the weekend. A victory would move him ahead of Clark in the world ranking, and a two-way tie for second might be enough to bump Morikawa.\n\nMorikawa still has the golf ball in his hand, even after a 74 on Friday left him in a tie for 51st going into the final two days at Pinehurst.\n\nCantlay has never spoken much about the Olympics, saying at the start of the year only that “any time you have the opportunity to represent your country, it’s important.” He was in a similar situation for the Tokyo Games, falling short in the final qualifying week at Torrey Pines.\n\nWinning a major was his top priority at Pinehurst.\n\nNick Taylor sewed up his spot in the Olympics by winning the Phoenix Open in early February, and it has been a revolving door of candidates ever since — Corey Conners, Adam Hadwin, Dallas winner Taylor Pendrith and Mackenzie Hughes.\n\nHadwin finished third at the Memorial and leaped past Conners for the No. 2 spot for Canada.\n\nBut then Hadwin missed the cut at the U.S. Open. Connors, with a game built for tough majors like the U.S. Open because of his supreme iron play, put together rounds of 69-70 and was tied for ninth going into the weekend.\n\nPendrith, who was 1-over par through two rounds at Pinehurst, also was still alive. Hadwin can only watch to see how it unfolds.\n\nConners would need to finish 11th alone at the U.S. Open to move past Hadwin. Pendrith would need at least a two-way tie for third (and then that might depend on what Conners does).\n\nTom Kim and Byeong Hun An appear to have the two spots locked up, especially with Sungjae Im missing the cut.\n\nThe only player who can bump out An — who missed the cut — is Si Woo Kim, though he would need a two-way tie for third. Kim was seven shots out of that position going into Saturday.\n\nAs for Im, he isn’t likely to lose any sleep over this. Im (and Si Woo Kim) won the team gold in the Asian Games last year in China, and that made them exempt from mandatory military service. For South Korean men, that’s better than gold.\n\nTeam Britain is set with Tommy Fleetwood and Matt Fitzpatrick after Justin Rose and Robert MacIntyre missed the cut.\n\nMost curious is Tyrrell Hatton, who is only four spots behind Fitzpatrick in the world ranking.\n\nHatton was tied for ninth through 36 holes at Pinehurst. Something in the top 10 might have been enough to move past Fitzpatrick. Something a little better might have given Britain three players because Hatton currently is at No. 20.\n\nHowever, Hatton decided to remove his name from Olympic qualifying and is no longer eligible.\n\nAdam Scott has never liked the idea of golf in the Olympics and removed his name from consideration, leaving Jason Day and Min Woo Lee virtually locked up for Australia.\n\nFormer British Open champion Cameron Smith is a long shot. He started the weekend at 3 over and would need to finish third to have any chance of bumping Lee.\n\nHere’s where it pays to play for LIV Golf (beyond the obvious).\n\nThe Saudi-backed league does not get world ranking points. That actually helped Puig when he compiled a series of good finishes on the Asian Tour because the ranking formula is points earned divided by tournaments played over a two-year period.\n\nPuig has the minimum divisor of 40. So does Garcia, another LIV player. Garcia could finish second at the U.S. Open and that would be enough to move past Puig.\n\nIt’s a long shot. And nothing is settled until the scores are in Sunday, the world ranking is published and the National Olympic Committee from each country certifies who’s going.\n\n___\n\nAP golf: https://apnews.com/hub/golf\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCopyright 2025 The Associated Press.

The four-time gold medallist has failed in her bid to become the first Australian to swim at five Olympics. “By God, I gave it a really good crack,” Campbell said.\n\nOn a Saturday night when pop star turned swimmer Cody Simpson also missed selection for the Paris Olympics, Campbell was seventh in the women’s 50m freestyle at Australia’s trials in Brisbane. Campbell, after missing qualifying for the 100m freestyle final by one-hundredth of a second on Friday night, ends her Olympic career with four gold, one silver and three bronze medals.\n\n“I had hoped for the fairytale ending,” the 32-year-old said. “And it’s what I had worked for and what I felt I was capable of, and unfortunately my body just said no. I came out and I gave it everything. I wasn’t going to throw in the towel, pardon the pun … unfortunately it wasn’t meant to be.”\n\nCampbell, who was Australia’s joint flag-bearer at the Tokyo Olympics of 2021, raced her first competition more than 20 years ago at the Brisbane Aquatic Centre. The full stop to her storied career came at the same pool.\n\n“I started in the sport because I was a little girl who loved swimming, I did, I loved it more than anything else,’’ she said. “And over the years that love has been tried and tested and that relationship has been pushed to its absolute limits and its breaking point.\n\n“I walked out tonight and I remembered that little girl who walked out behind those blocks for the first time and I remembered the joy and the love that I have for this sport. And I can leave the pool with peace and with love, which is a beautiful place to be.”\n\nSimpson, a junior swimmer who became a global teen pop sensation, then returned to the pool four years ago, finished fifth in the men’s 100m butterfly. “It’s bittersweet,” Simpson said. “I came a lot further in the last four years than perhaps I could have bargained for.” Simpson will now return to the entertainment industry. “The discipline and resilience and perseverance that swimming has again instilled in me is something that I’m really excited to implement in my future endeavours,” he said.\n\nCampbell and Simpson’s selection misses came as Australia named a 41-strong swim team, featuring 22 Olympic debutants, to race in Paris. Freestyle sprinter Cameron McEvoy, aged 30, will become the first Australian man to swim at four Olympics.\n\nSign up to Australia Sport\n\nGet a daily roundup of the latest sports news, features and comment from our Australian sports desk\n\nafter newsletter promotion\n\nAustralia’s most successful Olympian, Emma McKeon, will seek to add to her 11 career medals – five gold, two silver and four bronze – at her fourth Games. Cate Campbell’s sister Bronte will also swim at a fourth Olympics on a team featuring a batch of gold-medal favourites. Ariarne Titmus, the reigning Olympic champion and world record-holder in both the 200m and 400m freestyle, tops the list along with Kaylee McKeown.\n\nMcKeown, who holds word records and Olympic crowns in the 100m and 200m backstroke, has added the 200m individual medley to her Paris plans. McKeown or Titmus, who also swims the 800m freestyle, may become the first Australian to win three individual golds at a single Games.\n\nAt the Tokyo Olympics three years ago, Australia’s swimmers collected nine gold, three silver and eight bronze medals – the nation’s best haul at the pool. The Dolphins carry the bulk of Australia’s hopes for a successful campaign in Paris: swimmers have won 71 of the nation’s 167 gold medals at the Olympics."

(AP Photo/Michel Euler, File)\n\n\n\nThe first Olympic event in the cleaned-up Seine is men’s triathlon, including a 1.5-kilometer (under 1 mile) swim, on the morning of July 30. The women’s triathlon is the next day and a mixed relay event is on Aug. 5.\n\nMarathon swimming races over 10 kilometers (6.2 miles) for women and men are scheduled on Aug. 8 and 9, respectively, in waters that were historically polluted before a $1.5 billion investment ahead of the Olympics\n\n\n\n\n“We are confident that we will swim in the Seine this summer,” IOC official Christophe Dubi said Thursday at an online briefing after hearing an update Paris from city officials and Olympic organizers.\n\nA man walks in the Austerlitz wastewater and rainwater storage basin, which is intended to make the Seine River swimmable during the Olympic Games, in Paris, during its inauguration May 2, 2024. (Stephane de Sakutin/Pool Photo via AP)\n\n\n\nDespite the IOC’s publicly expressed confidence, the final decision on approving the events safe for athletes should rest with the governing bodies of individual sports, World Aquatics and World Triathlon. \n\nThe safety of the Seine water for the Olympics has been in doubt since some test events scheduled last August were cancelled, also after unseasonal heavy rains.\n\nAccording to European standards, the safe limit for E. coli is 900 colony-forming units per 100 milliliters. The World Triathlon Federation uses the same criteria to determine sufficient water quality for competitions.\n\nDuring the first eight days of June, test results showed that E. coli levels frequently exceeded these thresholds. Enterococci levels were better, mostly staying within safe limits. The tests indicated an improvement, from high contamination levels on June 1 to more acceptable levels by June 9, mainly due to improved weather. \n\nRainwater infiltrates the sewer system, and to prevent street flooding, the excess water, carrying fecal bacteria, is diverted into the Seine. To address this, a massive reservoir capable of storing 50,000 cubic meters of water during heavy rainfall was inaugurated in May. \n\nThe Alexander III bridge, center, is visible July 11, 2023, in Paris. In 2024. (AP Photo/Thomas Padilla)\n\n\n\nWater quality of rivers in major cities can be impacted by many things, from runoff to dumping of chemicals, sometimes illegally, and boat traffic. \n\nEarlier this week, Paris’ mayor Anne Hidalgo doubled down on her promise to take a dip in the river before the start of the competition. On Tuesday, she confirmed that her swim was postponed until after the snap elections in France, which end on July 7.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCopyright 2025 The Associated Press. All Rights Reserved."

(Supplied: Delly Carr)\n\nIt's been 16 years since Cate Campbell won a spot on her first Olympic team.\n\nNow, whether one of Australia's greatest ever sprint freestyle swimmers makes it to a fifth Games rests on whether she can conjure one last surge of power down a single lap of the Brisbane Aquatic Centre pool.\n\nCampbell was an 18-year-old when she won two bronze medals at that Games in Beijing: In the 4x100m relay alongside Libby Trickett (Lenton), Alice Mills and Melanie Schlanger, and in the 50m freestyle.\n\nAnd it's the 50m that holds all Campbell's hopes for making a fifth-straight Games in Paris after her 100m dreams ended in heartbreak on Friday morning.\n\nCampbell was crushed by the disappointment, both in missing the final and perhaps in the knowledge that it was illness that has cruelled her at the last.\n\nCate Campbell has one more chance to make the Olympic team. (Supplied: Delly Carr)\n\n\"I'm obviously really disappointed for Cate,\" said sister Bronte.\n\n\"I know she was a bit ill leading into this and had a really rough last few weeks.\n\nIn one of the highest-quality 100m freestyle fields in Australian swimming history, four-time Olympic gold medallist Cate Campbell misses out on making the final by just 0.01 seconds.\n\n\"I'm sure she'll be disappointed because we all know that she's an incredible athlete and can swim a lot faster than that.\"\n\nBronte, Cate's long-time training partner as well as a sister, could not speak higher of the swimmer she knows better than any other.\n\n\"I think she's one of the most incredible athletes that we've ever had in this event,\" she said after the 100m heats.\n\n\"I mean, she was a number-one freestyler, what — 10, 11, 12 years in a row? That's a feat that's pretty much unmatched in Australian sporting history.\"\n\nABC Sport is live blogging every day of the Paris Olympics\n\nABC Sport is live blogging every day of the Paris Olympics\n\nCate Campbell won bronze in the 50m free at the 2008 Games. (Getty Images: Cameron Spencer)\n\nAfter the final of the 100m on Friday night, where Bronte finished in fourth spot and booked a place in the relay team, she was emotional when talking about Cate's influence on her career.\n\n\"I felt devastated for my sister this morning,\" Bronte said on Channel 9.\n\n\"But she is absolutely incredible. I mean, she held this individual spot for 100m freestyle for 11 years. I think that's going to be a record in Australia. \n\n\"I want to pay homage to what an incredible athlete she is. I know she made me a better swimmer. \n\nFrom that first Games in 2008, Campbell has won 37 major international medals — 23 of them gold.\n\nThrough the countless injuries, health scares and doubts, Campbell is firmly established as one of the all-time greats of Australian swimming.\n\nAn admired and respected ambassador for the sport, one of Australia's two flag bearers at the Tokyo Games and now chair of the AOC Athletes' Commission.\n\nBut aside from all the out-the-pool accolades and honours, Campbell is, above all, a phenomenal competition swimmer. \n\nCampbell has been at the heart of the women's 4x100m relay since 2008, winning 10 global medals in that event alone.\n\nCate Campbell (right) has been a relay mainstay for Australia for 16 years. (Getty Images: picture alliance/Michael Kappeler)\n\nHer other Olympic gold also came in a relay, the 4x100m medley in Tokyo.\n\nShe has, inarguably, helped drive Australian sprinting to the next level.\n\n\"I inherited [Australia's sprinting legacy] from Libby [Trickett] and Jodie [Henry] and Alice [Tait],\" Campbell told the AOC in 2023.\n\n\"I feel like I've helped drive the women's 100m freestyle globally.\"\n\nNot just globally, but domestically too.\n\n\"Cate's one of those phenomenons that will last forever,\" Shayna Jack said after Friday's final.\n\n\"I grew up idolising Cate, and then I trained with Cate, and then Cate became a massive mentor because she's been through some difficult times in her past. \n\n\"So I really was grateful for every bit of wisdom she could pass on.\"\n\nThe age of the finalists in last night's 100m freestyle ranged from 30-year-old's Emma McKeon and Bronte Campbell to 17-year-old Jansen Milla.\n\n\"I mean like you've seen in the past four or five years there's rookies getting on the team that have swum absolutely incredibly,\" 22-year-old Meg Harris said following the heats.\n\n\"There's so many of us, it's just, that's the way it's going to be.\" \n\nCate Campbell has less than 25 seconds of swimming to earn her spot. (AAP: Dave Hunt)\n\nAustralia has extraordinary strength in depth in the 100m freestyle — as evidenced by their three-straight Olympic titles in the 4x100m relay.\n\nABC Sport Daily is your daily sports conversation. We dive into the biggest story of the day and get you up to speed with everything else that's making headlines.\n\nThat depth is matched by the field in Saturday's 50m free too, making Campbell's task incredibly tough.\n\nIt seems almost cruel that a career so decorated will be determined by how Campbell performs in a maximum of two swims lasting less than 25 seconds each.\n\nBut perhaps there's a sliver of romance in her opportunity for one last hurrah takes place in the 50m sprint.\n\nAfter all, it was a 50m free that earned Campbell a first individual Olympic medal in Beijing.\n\nAnd Campbell doesn't have to look far for inspiration, only into her own past.\n\nCate Campbell could look to Dara Torres for inspiration to get over the line in the 50m. (Getty Images: Harry How)\n\nWinning silver in that event was American symbol of swimming longevity, Dara Torres, who became swimming's oldest silver medallist aged 41 at that Games.\n\nCampbell, at 32, is the oldest swimmer in the 97-strong field that features a handful of girls who were not even born when Campbell swum in her first Games.\n\nNow would be a great time to show the world that there is still enough in the tank for one last great swim.\n\nDo you have a story idea about women in sport?\n\nEmail us abcsport5050@your.abc.net.au\n\nTopic:NRL\n\nTopic:Paralympic Games\n\nTopic:Sport\n\nTopic:Police\n\nTopic:State of Origin\n\nTopic:Health\n\nAnalysis by Patricia Karvelas\n\nTopic:Foreign Aid\n\nTopic:Alternative Energy\n\nTopic:Courts\n\nTopic:Swimming\n\nTopic:Swimming\n\nTopic:Sport\n\nTopic:Swimming\n\nTopic:Swimming\n\nTopic:Swimming\n\nTopic:Swimming\n\nBrisbane\n\nOlympic Games\n\nSport\n\nSwimming\n\nTopic:Health\n\nAnalysis by Patricia Karvelas\n\nTopic:Foreign Aid\n\nTopic:Alternative Energy\n\nTopic:Courts\n\nTopic:World War 2\n\nTopic:Children's Health\n\nTopic:Activism and Lobbying\n\nTopic:Indigenous Culture\n\nWe acknowledge Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples as the First Australians and Traditional Custodians of the lands where we live, learn, and work.\n\nThis service may include material from Agence France-Presse (AFP), APTN, Reuters, AAP, CNN and the BBC World Service which is copyright and cannot be reproduced.\n\nAEST = Australian Eastern Standard Time which is 10 hours ahead of GMT (Greenwich Mean Time)"

They were not suspended in either incident.\n\nBy Michael S. Schmidt and Tariq Panja\n\nAfter the revelation in April that 23 elite Chinese swimmers had tested positive for a banned substance months before the last Summer Olympic Games, China and the global antidoping authority vigorously defended their decisions to allow them to compete in the Games in 2021. The swimmers, they insisted, had not been doping.\n\nBut as they made those claims, China and the antidoping authority were both aware that three of those 23 swimmers had tested positive several years earlier for a different performance-enhancing drug and had escaped being publicly identified and suspended in that case as well, according to a secret report reviewed by The New York Times.\n\nIn both instances, China claimed that the swimmers had unwittingly ingested the banned substances, an explanation viewed with considerable skepticism by some antidoping experts. The two incidents add to longstanding suspicions among rival athletes about what they see as a pattern of Chinese doping and the unwillingness or inability of the global authority, the World Anti-Doping Agency, to deal with it.\n\nThe three Chinese athletes revealed to have tested positive earlier, in 2016 and 2017, were no ordinary swimmers: Two would go on to win gold medals at the Tokyo Olympic Games in 2021, and the third is now a world-record holder. All three are expected to contend for medals again at the Paris Games in July.\n\nAntidoping experts say that if Chinese officials and WADA had abided by existing rules with both sets of positive tests, the athletes would have been publicly identified and subject to further scrutiny, and could have been disqualified from the 2021 Olympics, and possibly the Games that open in Paris next month.\n\n“Athletes we have spoken to are appalled with the antidoping system and WADA,” said Rob Koehler, the director general of Global Athlete, a group working for athletes’ rights. “Athletes are expected to follow the antidoping rules to a T, but yet the very organization holding them accountable does not have to.”\n\nWe are having trouble retrieving the article content.\n\nPlease enable JavaScript in your browser settings.\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.

Archive photo via Jack Spitser/Spitser Photography \n\n15 Jun 2024 – 23 Jun 2024 \n\nA lot of changes have occurred as the 9 teams in the men’s 4×200 free relay have released their line-ups for tonight’s final. \n\nSouth Africa’s Tatjana Smith joins an elite crowd as both one of three African women to win multiple Olympic Golds as well as the first swimmer since 1996 to have won both the 100 and 200 Breast. \n\nOut of over 900 athletes competing at Trials, Louisville’s Tommy Bried improved the most from seed time across his meet. \n\nIn Fukuoka, WR holder Lilly King rebounded from a poor individual performance to lead the team to gold.

Today, we rank the top-10 swims of the meet.\n\nJune 14th, 2024  National, News, Previews & Recaps, U.S. Olympic Trials\n\nThe women’s 1500 freestyle is being competed at the Olympic Games for only the second time this year following its introduction to the event’s lineup in Tokyo. In Tokyo, Katie Ledecky claimed the top spot on the podium by a wide margin, swimming a time of 15:37.34, finishing almost 5 seconds ahead of the field. Since then, Ledecky has only gotten faster, posting a time of 15:30.15 at the 2022 World Championships before dropping a 15:26.27 in 2023. In fact, at the 2023 World Championships, Ledecky finished over 15 seconds ahead of the field, only increasing her margin of victory from Tokyo. Therefore, it only appears imminent that Ledecky wins this race at Trials and then progresses on to the gold in Paris. \n\nIt might also be worthwhile to watch the World Record line in this race, with Ledecky’s current record standing at 15:20.48. Though she hasn’t hit that time since 2018, Ledecky hasn’t had many opportunities to race the 1500 tapered and could have more in the tank with some rest. \n\nThe only question that remains is: who will be joining Ledecky in Paris? \n\nBehind Ledecky, there are a slew of young distance stars itching to get a bite at Olympic glory. \n\nKatie Grimes (photo: Jack Spitser)\n\nKatie Grimes was the youngest member of the 2021 US Olympic Team, making the roster in the 800 freestyle at just 15-years-old (reminiscent of a young Ledecky). Since then, Grimes has matured into a seasoned distance star. In addition to finding her stride in the pool, Grimes has become one of the top open water swimmers in the world. Last year, she had a stunning race in the open water 10km at the 2023 World Championships to book a ticket to her second Olympic Games in Paris. This season, she holds the 2nd fastest time in the country with her 15:57.31 from the CA Meet of Champions, only coming in behind Ledecky. In addition, Grimes’ time ranks her over 10 seconds ahead of her remaining competitors. \n\nGiven that Grimes has already qualified for Paris, it’s almost certain that she will not be fully rested at Trials. However, since she has been training to race 10km at the Olympics, she will probably have a really great anaerobic base for the longest event in the pool. \n\nJillian Cox has also risen through the rankings since Tokyo, qualifying for the 2023 World Championships in the 800 freestyle via a massive personal best at the US National Championships. At those same Championships, Cox finished 5th in the 1500 with a personal best time of 16:18.40. Just before that meet, she swam a time of 16:31.00 Mission Viejo Pro Swim Series. This season, she has already been 16:20.83, setting herself up very well for this event at Trials. \n\nKate Hurst might not be well known on the senior level right now, but she certainly will be after Trials. Hurst won the 1500 free at the 2023 World Junior Championships, swimming a personal best 16:09.37 in the process. That time currently ranks her 3rd in the country this season behind Ledecky and Grimes. Though she hasn’t competed in the 1500 much since World Juniors ended last September, Hurst has proven that she can show up when it counts, taking down some of the best junior swimmers in the world. The only question remains: can she translate that success to the senior level? \n\nKayla Han was the other entrant in the 1500 freestyle at World Juniors last fall, where she finished 5th in a very tight race (16:19.07), missing a medal by less than a second. Since then, Han has gained even more valuable experience, representing the United States at the 2024 World Championships in multiple events. Han is also not a stranger to the Olympic Trials stage as she was the youngest competitor at the 2021 Trials meet at only 13-years-old. Her best time only stands at 16:16.94, slower than the likes of Grimes and Hurst, but Han is still very young having just turned 16, leaving plenty of room for her to have some big drops. \n\nClaire Weinstein (photo: Jack Spitser)\n\nAnother junior swimmer to watch out for is Grimes’ Sandpipers of Nevada teammate Claire Weinstein. Though more known for her 200 freestyle prowess, Weinstein has recently been experimenting with some longer events, placing 3rd in the 800 freestyle at the 2023 US National Championships. Weinstein is currently entered to swim this event at Trials, holding the 4th seed with her best time of 16:09.85 from 2023. In the past, there has been an event conflict between the 200 free and 1500 free at many major international meets, limiting the possibility of Weinstein trying out the event. However, that conflict does not exist in Paris or at Trials. If Weinstein decides to swim this event, she could very easily be in contention, especially if she’s anywhere close to her best.\n\nFormer Sandpiper Bella Sims is also entered in this event, holding the 11th seed. However, Sims is entered in a whopping 11 events right now, meaning she’ll likely drop this one, especially considering its proximity to the 100 freestyle at Trials if she wants to go for a relay  spot. \n\nThere are three members of the 2021 Olympic Team who will be looking to make it back to the world’s biggest stage. \n\nErica Sullivan (photo: Jack Spitser)\n\nErica Sullivan is one of the biggest names to watch in this event. Sullivan won the silver medal in this event in Tokyo, throwing down a huge personal best 15:41.41 to finish fairly close to Ledecky and give the Americans a 1-2 sweep in the event. Since then, Sullivan has encountered a few injuries that have hindered her progress, including a shoulder injury that kept her out of the 2022 US International Team Trials, preventing her from following-up her Olympic performance. Though she hasn’t been close to her best time since 2021, Sullivan posted a 16:16.94 at the US National Championships last summer to finish 4th, a finish that was promoted to 3rd place following the recent suspension of Kensey McMahon for a positive doping test. \n\nPaige Madden was also on the Olympic Team in 2021, competing in the 400 freestyle and 4×200 freestyle relay. Like Sullivan, Madden has struggled a little since Tokyo, failing to qualify for the 2022 or 2023 World Championship Teams. However, Madden seems to be on an upswing recently, posting a personal best in the 400 freestyle a few weeks ago (4:03.02). Like Weinstein and Sims, Madden might opt to drop this event in favor of shorter races. Yet, she holds the 5th seed with a best time of 16:09.93, which she set this year at the Pro Swim Series in Westmont. \n\nAshley Twichell represented the US in open water at the 2021 Olympics. Since then, Twichell has taken a significant break from the sport, having her first child with husband Derek Wall in May 2022. However, that has not stopped Wall from pursuing another Olympic berth, this time in the pool. She posted a time of 16:22.69 in the 1500 free at the Atlanta Classic earlier this year, good for 10th in the country this season. Though Twichell will need to drop some significant time to have a shot at another Olympic Team, she has proven that she should not be underestimated. \n\nRachel Stege (photo: Jack Spitser)\n\n has slowly built up her NCAA and international resume over the past few seasons to become one of the top distance swimmers in the country. At the 2024 NCAA Championships, Stege finished 5th in the 500 free (4:37.26). Earlier in the season, she represented the US at the 2023 Pan American Games, her first senior level international team. At Pan Ams, she posted a PB in the 1500 free en route to a major gold medal winning performance, swimming a time of 16:13.59 that ranks her 6th on the psych sheets for the meet. \n\nAurora Roghair has also had a huge year. The Stanford star capped off a strong NCAA season with a personal best and runner-up finish in the 1650 free at the National Championships (15:41.11). She then carried that momentum into the long course season, posting a personal best of 16:19.79 in the 1500 freestyle at the Trojan Invite last month. That time currently ranks her 12th on the psych sheets and 8th in the country this season. If Roghair continues this momentum, Trials could be another huge opportunity for her. \n\nAnother name to watch out for is Paige McKenna, who won the 1650 free at the 2022 NCAA Championships. McKenna didn’t have the best NCAA season this year, only finishing 9th in the 1650 at NCAAs. However, she posted a 16:22.76 last summer at the European 23 and under Championships, taking 2nd at the meet. She currently enters the meet seeded 13th behind Roghair. \n\nLike Grimes, Mariah Denigan is already qualified to swim in Paris in the open water events. The Indiana swimmer had a decent showing at the NCAA Championships this year, but has not competed in any meets since then. She holds a lifetime best of 16:12.44 from the 2022 International Team Trials, which would put her right in the mix. \n\nTop 8 Picks: \n\nDarkhorse Pick: Abby McCulloh – The reigning 1650 free NCAA Champion, McCulloh had a breakout season this year, dropping her best time in the 1650 by a wide margin down to 15:37.74. McCulloh has already gone multiple best times in the long course pool this season, dropping her personal best in the 1500 free to a 16:24.90 last month at the Atlanta Classic. With that time, McCulloh currently ranks 15th entering the meet. However, if her NCAA performance indicates anything, it’s that she might have more left in the tank at Trials. \n\n \n\n\n\nΔ\n\n\n\nΔ\n\nKate Hurst deserves to be on the 2024 Olympic team\n\nTop 10 name to throw in the mix. Gena Jorgenson.\n\nI want to point out that Rachel Stege has gone from 16:33 to 16:29 in June of 2023, and then in November from 16:29 to 16:13. If that says anything, it’s not out of the realm of possibilities for her to drop another 10+ seconds, especially in the trials spotlight. I’m not saying she’s my favorite for second, but if the stars align for her (she drops another 10-15 seconds in this race), and Grimes has a “off meet” Stege could possibly grab second. Thoughts ?\n\nIn a perfect world, yes… But Stege is very inconsistent with her times. She went this crazy 4:32 500 back in november, with a 25 on her last 50, and then wasn’t under 4:35 at NC’s. Not sure if it’s an injury of some sort (I know she’s had shoulder problems in the past), but I’m not going to go as far as to say she’s a potential upset.\n\nAccording to people I know close to the UGA program, yes, Stege suffered a resurgence of her shoulder problems around January of this year and they lingered into SECs and NCAAs. I’m of the firm belief Stege would’ve been the 500 NCAA champ if she were fully healthy all season. That being said, apparently her shoulder has remained at bay since January, so there’s definitely a possibility she is healthy enough to surprise some people, but we know how volatile shoulder injuries are.\n\nThere is no comparison whatsoever in the personal best times.\n\nHow is Katie Grimes going to have an off meet after winning the 10k title at the 2024 Open Water National Championships six weeks ago?\n\nGrimes an obvious #2 but if she’s having a bad meet, who knows? Weinstein has never had a great 1500 but when you beat Ledecky in the 200 and then win international 5k races, you’d think she could break through here. Mystery. Outside the top 2 or 3, anyone’s guess but Roghair will make the final.\n\nThere is no comparison whatsoever in the personal best times.\n\nWomen’s 1500 meter freestyle\nGrimes, Katie – 15:44.89\nHurst, Kate – 16.09.37\nWeinstein, Claire – 16:09.85\nMadden, Paige – 16:09.93\nRoghair, Aurora – 16:19.79\n\nKatie x 2\n\nLets go Stege!!!\n\nThe “let Bella sprint crowd” won’t tolerate Sims swimming the 1500 FR in lieu of the 100 FR.\n\nIf a “pint-sized” 16 year old from the Carmel Swim Club finishes ahead of Erica Sullivan in the 1500 FR, the University of Texas women’s swimming head coach Carol Capitani should be fired on the spot.\n\nIf a pint-sized air molecule that’s already next to the touchpad reaches the touchpad before Torri Huske does in the 100 fly, the Stanford University women’s swimming head coach Greg Meehan should be fired on the spot\n\nI will laugh my ass off if the “pint-sized” 16 year old from the Carmel Swim Club outperforms the Stanford women’s swimming program in the W 1500 FR.\n\nA bit dehumanizing if you ask me. Maybe update your title after this meet and check yourself before making a rude claim/remark to someone’s career.\n\nNicole has been with SwimSwam since April 2020, as both a reporter and social media contributor.

Archive photo via Jack Spitser/Spitser Photography \n\n15 Jun 2024 – 23 Jun 2024 \n\nA lot of changes have occurred as the 9 teams in the men’s 4×200 free relay have released their line-ups for tonight’s final. \n\nSouth Africa’s Tatjana Smith joins an elite crowd as both one of three African women to win multiple Olympic Golds as well as the first swimmer since 1996 to have won both the 100 and 200 Breast. \n\nOut of over 900 athletes competing at Trials, Louisville’s Tommy Bried improved the most from seed time across his meet. \n\nIn Fukuoka, WR holder Lilly King rebounded from a poor individual performance to lead the team to gold. In Paris, now flanked by two new WR holders, King and co will look to regain the top of the Olympic podium. \n\nAmerican men were faster than Australians in 11 of 14 individual events at last month’s Olympic Trials while the women’s side was tied at 7-7.\n\nLucas Oil Stadium averaged 55.9% capacity across 17 sessions and set a record for attendance at a single session of a swim meet. \n\nOut of the 26 athletes who represented the U.S. in Doha, five went on to become first-time Olympians at U.S. Trials, including Shaine Casas and Carson Foster.\n\nFor the first time since 2008, World Records were broken at the 2024 US Olympic Swimming Trials. Today, we rank the top-10 swims of the meet.\n\nJune 14th, 2024  National, News, Previews & Recaps, U.S. Olympic Trials\n\nLast season we saw eight American men go under the 22-second barrier in the 50 free, but there was one glaring name missing atop the heap.\n\nCaeleb Dressel is still the defending Olympic champion and the fastest American in history by more than three tenths of a second, but his status as the favorite heading into the 2024 U.S. Olympic Trials is up for debate.\n\nDressel made it look ridiculously easy en route to winning Olympic gold in the 50 free three years ago. He tied the American Record at the Olympic Trials, clocking 21.04 to finish a whopping 69 one-hundredths clear of the 3rd-place finisher. He then won the Olympic final over Florent Manaudou by a bigger margin (0.48) than he did over Michael Andrew (0.44) at the Trials.\n\nCaeleb Dressel (photo: Jack Spitser)\n\nPrior to those Trials when Dressel was on career-best form, his fastest in-season time was 21.82. In 2022, before going 21.29 at the International Team Trials, he was 21.86 in-season.\n\nWhile working his way back from an extended hiatus last year, his fastest swim was 22.57 at the Atlanta Classic, ranking him 31st among Americans in 2022-23 after four straight as #1.\n\nThis season? On paper, he’s back. Dressel’s season-best in 2023-24 stands at 21.84, right on par with where he was the two previous years before his break from the sport.\n\nDressel was 21.99 in November, 21.84 in March and then 21.85 in April. All signs point to him ripping something under 21.5 and comfortably qualifying for the Olympic team in this event.\n\nWe’ll have a good gauge of where Dressel is by the time the 50 free kicks off on Thursday, with the 100 free being his first race on the schedule with the final on Wednesday night. However, even at his best he should have a tight race in the 100 free, while in the 50, it should be relatively clear-cut if he’s on.\n\nAny talk about Michael Andrew and his lack of consistency doesn’t usually involve in the 50 free, as the 25-year-old has represented the United States in the event in five of the last six major international meets (including the 2018 Pan Pacs), winning silver at the 2022 World Championships and placing 4th at both the 2021 Olympics and 2024 Worlds.\n\nJack Alexy (photo: Jack Spitser)\n\nAt last year’s Nationals when he missed the Worlds team for the first time since 2017, Andrew was still on form in the sprints and took 3rd in the 50 free, finishing .01 shy of runner-up Jack Alexy.\n\nAndrew has already been under 22 seconds eight times this season, and has as good a case as anyone to qualify for the Olympics in this event.\n\nAlexy’s rapid rise to the top of the U.S. in the sprint freestyle events started at Nationals, but really took off at the World Championships in Fukuoka, following up his silver medal in the 100 free with another in the 50 free, setting a new lifetime best of 21.57.\n\nAlexy has proven he can execute his optimal performance when all the chips are down. Outside of the Games, it doesn’t bigger than the U.S. Olympic Trials, so the pressure shouldn’t affect him.\n\nSitting atop the U.S. rankings in each of the past two seasons is Ryan Held, who set a lifetime best of 21.50 at last year’s National Championships.\n\nHe placed 5th at the World Championships (21.72) and has been back on form this season, ripping a time of 21.68 in April.\n\nThe 28-year-old leads a massive group of swimmers training out of Arizona State who will contest the men’s 50 free at Trials.\n\n10% of the men entered in the 50 free at Olympic Trials currently train at ASU. pic.twitter.com/7U4VdLd0uS\n\n— Herbie Behm (@SirHerb_the3rd) June 9, 2024\n\n\n\nThe other ASU product holding a top eight seed is Jonny Kulow, who was 5th at the 2023 Nationals in 21.87, ranking him #3 all-time in the boys’ 17-18 age group. After another impressive college season, making the ‘A’ final of the 50 free at NCAAs, Kulow has picked up right where he left off in long course, clocking 21.89 at the San Antonio Pro Swim to rank 6th in the nation.\n\n2023-24 U.S. Rankings, Men’s 50 Freestyle (LCM)\n\nASU’s Jack Dolan (22.12), Jack Schuster (22.22) and Patrick Sammon (22.41) also hold top-24 seeds in the 50 free.\n\nDolan swam that time at the PSS stop in San Antonio, tying him for 10th this season in the nation.\n\nThe lone swimmer we’ve yet to mention who has broken 22 seconds in each of the last four seasons is David Curtiss, who got some experience in the 2021 Olympic Trials final and had a big international victory last October with a gold medal at the Pan Am Games in 21.85.\n\nDavid Curtiss (photo: Jack Spitser)\n\nCurtiss’ fastest swim at a selection meet is 21.89, done en route to 6th place at the 2023 Nationals. His PB of 21.76 stems from a 2022 PSS meet. Having left NC State and moving to train with the TAC Titans, Curtiss’ ability to churn out 21s has not gone away, making him a likely member of the championship final in Indianapolis.\n\nMatt King, who like Curtiss, stopped competing in the NCAA (though he’s returning next season) and headed elsewhere to dial in on long course training, working with Coley Stickels at Texas Ford Aquatics.\n\nKing set a PB of 21.83 at the 2022 Summer Nationals and brought that mark down to 21.80 at last year’s selection meet, placing 4th. He got some international experience at the 2024 World Championships, placing 14th in 21.99.\n\nLike Curtiss, we expect to see King in the final, but they’ll both need to drop a few tenths and get into the 21-mid range to have a chance at a roster spot.\n\nBrooks Curry and Chris Guiliano, both 100 free specialists, are also both strong candidates for the final, with Curry hitting 21-point in 2022 and 2023 and Guiliano doing so for the first time last summer.\n\nGuiliano is also coming off a big short course season that included dropping his 50 SCY time from 18.88 to 18.43.\n\nNC State’s Quintin McCarty is coming off an impressive redshirt freshman year that included a big PB of 21.94 in long course, done at the U.S. Open at the end of November. Most recently, he went 22.25 at the NC WAVE Sprint meet in late April.\n\nDrew Kibler, who was training at Arizona State up until recently when Bob Bowman moved to Texas, was in the ‘A’ final last year at Nationals, while Florida’s Adam Chaney won the consolation final in 22.04.\n\nChaney set a PB of 22.00 at the 2021 Olympic Trials, so he’s proven he can step up when it counts.\n\nHunter Armstrong is the other name to keep an eye on. He’ll be more focused on the 100 back and 100 free next week, but with the 50 free coming at the end of the program, he’s an ‘A’ final threat after clocking 22.12 at the U.S. Open and owning a best time of 22.00 from the 2022 Trials.\n\nDark Horse: August Lamb – Virginia’s Lamb owns a best time of 22.23 from March of 2021, but is coming off producing his fastest swim in three years earlier this month at the NCAP Elite Qualifier (22.31). Lamb earned a semi-finals berth at the 2021 Olympic Trials, and he’s rounding back into the type of form that can get him there again.\n\n\n\nΔ\n\n\n\nΔ\n\nUntil he gets beaten in a high profile meet, Dressel will always be my pick. 21.8 despite a faulty block is ridiculous btw.\n\nMA is my pick for sec. Gotta pick a pure sprinter for the pure sprint event.\n\nThe Alexy and Dressel glazing continues…\n\nReigning olympic champ deserves all the glaze\n\nAnd Alexy won two silvers at Worlds, so. Also not that bad.\n\nDavid Curtiss is extremely washed\n\nYou’ve got to be pretty washed to be throwing shade at someone who is no doubt trying to do the best he can.\n\nMargin for error is so slim in this event. Making the team in the 50 will be difficult. I think Dressel & Alexy get there, but Alexy might get there first.\n\nMaybe but Dressel is probably has the best start and he is really good when it comes to getting to the wall first in a close race.\n\nI’m assuming Alexy has improved his start and breakout, which was a significant issue last year. If that is the case, Dressel could lose that race. I don’t see Dressel getting to his prior PB form or slightly slower. \n\nWe’ll see. It’s an interesting race.\n\nI also sense Alexi + Dresses will get the spots but not in which order\n\nI’ll make sure to watch that race. Although I’m picking those two, and I may have sounded confident in writing, my actual confidence level actually is not 100%. Just one little error……\n\nSanto\n\nThose finals picks feel too “chalk” for me. Of those, I feel like King, Curtiss and Curry might be outside the top 8.\n\nI don’t have good David Curtiss vibes for doing much this week.\n\nHe’s turned off since summer 2022 sadly\n\nAmerican Men that have broken 22 FLAT START since Tokyo\n\nCaeleb Dressel\nJack Alexy\nRyan Held\nCOACH PETER ANDREW\nMatt King\nQuintin McCarty\nChris Guiliano\nBrooks Curry\nJonny Kulow\nDavid Curtiss\n(Santo doesn’t count because he’s trying to represent every country on the planet and cannot choose one)\n\nDolan and Armstrong have also been sneaking around the 22-low area so you never know\n\nDepth in this event like the 100 is insane and we could see the entire A final go sub 22\n\nI honestly think depth gets used improperly.  I consider us deep in the women’s 100/200 backstroke because we have so many medal contenders who will be left home.  I don’t know if everyone in that group can seriously contend for a medal.\n\nThat depends on the criteria, such as the number of swimmers under the OQT in the final of the event.\n\nJames swam five years at Laurentian University in Sudbury, Ontario, specializing in the 200 free, back and IM.

How one can not be bothered by their name being used to justify racism, bigotry, misogyny, xenophobia, homophobia & the intersectionalities of them all is nuts,” Carrington tweeted. “We all see the sh*t. We all have a platform. We all have a voice & they all hold weight. Silence is a luxury.”\n\nCarrington’s tweet came Thursday afternoon after Clark was asked a series of questions by The Athletic’s Jim Trotter regarding her feelings on how some have weaponized her name.\n\nWhile there are plenty of healthy debates on Clark about her play, including whether she should have made the Olympics team, there are those who have been accused of using her name in cultural wars and spreading hate.\n\nAuthor David Dennis Jr. recently said on “Around the Horn” during a discussion about Clark’s Team USA exclusion that individuals use the former Iowa star  to “lash out” at black women.\n\n“The problem here is, and what concerns me going forward, is the people on the fringe that do exist, that are in real life, not just Internet trolls — politicians, pundits, and people of the like —  who are using Caitlin Clark as an avatar to lash out at the people who they have disdain for, mainly the makeup of the WNBA, black women et al.,” Dennis said. “They are using her to go against Team USA. That is going to be the big tragedy here, how they are treated by those people that summer.”\n\nTrotter asked Clark directly her thoughts on the issue Thursday morning before she scored seven points in a 91-84 win over the Dream.\n\n“It seems no matter what you do or what’s done to you, it becomes a topic nationally and a lot of times it becomes divisive,” Trotter asked. “I wonder, from your standpoint, how you feel about people using your name in whatever culture wars or whatever wars they are fighting, how do you feel about that?\n\n“It’s not something I can control so I don’t put too much thought and time into thinking about things like that,” Clark responded. “To be honest, I don’t see a lot of it. Like I’ve said, basketball is my job. Everything on the outside, I can’t control that so I’m not going to spend time thinking about that.\n\n“’People can talk about what they want to talk about, create conversations about whatever it is. But I think, for myself, I am just here to play basketball. I’m here to have fun. I’m trying to help our team win. … I don’t pay much mind to all of that, to be honest.”\n\nTrotter then asked how much she believes that has affected her ability to develop relationships in the league.\n\n“I think everybody in the league understands, one, we’re excited about all this attention we’re getting. I think we’re appreciative of it, I think the league’s been great for a really long time,” Clark said. “My focus is on my teammates. They’ve been amazing. I don’t think it’s impacted me making relationships on my team.”\n\nClark expanded on her teammates before Trotter followed with: “I understand you’re focused, I’m just curious, though, are you bothered…”\n\n“No,” Clark interjected.\n\n“That folks would attempt to weaponize your name in whatever fight they’re fighting,” he finished.\n\n“No. I don’t see it, that’s not where my focus is,” Clark said. “My focus is here and on basketball and that’s where it needs to be and that’s where it has been and I’m just trying to get better on a daily basis.”\n\nCarrington tweeted her opinion on Clark’s comments roughly four hours later, although she did not name Clark in the tweet.\n\nThe two have a brief history already, with Carrington mocking Clark for embellishing contact on a foul call during the Sun’s win over the Fever on Monday.\n\nClark spoke again hours later and The Athletic’s James Boyd followed up with another question about the topic, this time listing the direct issues at hand.\n\n“When people use your name for racism, misogyny, whatever, what is your response to that specifically,” Boyd asked.\n\nClark had a much different tone for this answer.\n\n“I think it’s disappointing,” Clark said. “Everybody in our world deserves the same amount of respect. The women in our league deserve the same amount of respect. People should not be using my name to push those agendas. It’s disappointing. It’s not acceptable. This league is the league I grew up admiring and wanting to be a part of. \n\n“Some of the women in this league were my biggest idols and role models growing up, and helped me want to achieve this moment right here that I get to play in every single night. Just treating every single woman in this league with the same amount of respect is just a basic human thing that everyone should do. Just be a kind person and treat them how you would want to be treated. I think it’s very simple.”\n\nCarrington did not tweet her reaction to Clark’s second remarks.\n\nClark and the Fever face the Sky on Sunday in a highly anticipated rematch following Chennedy Carter’s hip-check of Clark that sparked national discussions.\n\nIndiana aims to win back-to-back games for the first time.\n\nAdvertisement"

The letter discussed micro-dosing with EPO in the off-season and how to trick the whereabouts system.\n\nDavid Howman, who served as WADA's director-general for 13 years and is now the chair of the Athletics Integrity Unit (AIU), was asked about the latest Bol development in an interview with Wide World of Sports.\n\nAustralian Olympic runner Peter Bol at the postponed Tokyo Olympics. Tim Clayton/Corbis via Getty Images\n\n\"Ross Wenzel is a very good lawyer. I've got to say that at the outset. I don't see him being the sort of lawyer who would ever try to manoeuvre in a wrong way,\" Howman told Wide World of Sports over Zoom.\n\n\"I just find it a little bit unusual [the screenshot being raised] without understanding the full context.\n\n\"Peter Bol did not transgress the rules ... He may have been a person under suspicion, but he's not a convicted doper.\"\n\nBol had agreed for details from his case to be used during Croatian footballer Mario Vuskovic's hearing at CAS.\n\nIt was claimed during the hearing that Bol's phone was found to be clean, which prompted Wenzel to comment on the screenshot found on Bol's phone.\n\nPaul Greene, the lawyer for Bol and the Croatian footballer, unloaded.\n\n\"They [WADA] are still defaming Mr. Bol in this hearing,\" Greene said during the hearing, which can be viewed by the public on the CAS website.\n\n\"It's just a total disgrace.\"\n\nDavid Howman, pictured during his 13 years as director-general of the World Anti-Doping Authority, has responded to the latest Peter Bol drugs development. Clive Brunskill/Getty Images\n\nHowman admitted to WWOS it was \"a bit of a shock\" to read about the development in the media.\n\nWenzel said the screenshot was discovered on Bol's phone a month and five days before the middle-distance runner returned what was eventually found to be a false positive.\n\n\"When he was interviewed about this and asked about the screenshot which was on his phone — it was not in his search history, it was actually something that had been saved on his phone — the answer was, 'Oh, I read a lot of things, I am interested in learning and all that',\" Wenzel said.\n\nHowman said he was concerned about the Bol case from the moment the Melbourne-based athlete was provisionally suspended.\n\n\"At the AIU we are now very cautious about provisional suspensions for ... EPO cases because we are a little bit worried that in this area there can be Bs which don't match the As,\" Howman said.\n\n\"That concern can be seen as real when in Bol's case the B did not match the A.\n\n\"... I'm not sure that concern is overcome yet. I know he's back running ... I was worried that nothing had been done to remedy the situation.\n\n\"Now, this thing worsens; it doesn't remedy it.\"\n\nWADA provided a statement to WWOS.\n\n\"... WADA makes no further comment about Mr. Bol or his case except to say that following a review put in place in light of the peculiarities of that case, WADA continues to have no reason to question the validity of the analytical method used for recombinant EPO,\" part of the WADA statement read.\"\n\nSport Integrity Australia, Athletics Australia and the Bol camp all declined to comment when contacted by WWOS.\n\nBut Athletics Australia chief executive Peter Bromley spoke to The Age about the development last month.\n\n\"Sport Integrity Australia concluded their investigations on Peter last year and exonerated him,\" Bromley said.\n\n\"From our perspective, this case is closed, and we support Peter and his ongoing preparations for the Paris Olympics.\"\n\n8 minutes ago\n\n20 minutes ago\n\n48 minutes ago\n\n© 2025 Nine Entertainment Co."

Clubs don’t just breach players for what Smith called a “complete misunderstanding” about a scheduled meeting.\n\nRoosters coach Trent Robinson, hooker Brandon Smith and chairman Nick Politis.Credit: Getty/Bethany Rae\n\nIf the opinion of the senior players counts for anything, there’s no appetite for Smith to return any time soon.\n\nI’ll tread carefully here because Smith has been receiving support from the club for well over a year for private matters that should remain that way.\n\nNevertheless, the Roosters have grown tired of his lack of discipline and the effect it’s had on his football. His ability isn’t in question, but his consistency from week to week is.\n\nThe club rolled out the red carpet to secure Smith: clandestine coffees with chairman Nick Politis, long lunches with directors, games of golf at Monash with the boys.\n\nRoosters hooker Brandon Smith is losing the support of teammates.Credit: Getty\n\nTheir pitch was mostly about Smith’s life beyond football. A Rooster for life is set up for life. Now, there are questions about whether he’ll be there beyond this season.\n\nThe Roosters rarely get it wrong, but they should have seen the trouble with Smith coming. His reputation preceded him.\n\nSure, he’s a knockabout. As they say, he’s a character who goes by the nickname ‘Cheese’. He’s easy to like and laugh at. But you didn’t have to be Columbo to know he could be a handful.\n\nThere were concerns from the moment he was linked to the Roosters about how he’d handle the bright lights of Sydney instead of the relative anonymity of Melbourne.\n\nSay Cheese: Brandon Smith was a fan favourite in Melbourne.Credit: NRL Photos\n\nPart of Melbourne’s pitch to keep him was very much along those lines. The other part was coach Craig Bellamy and his special ability to allow extroverts to be themselves but not a disruption to his team.\n\nSome at the Roosters are floating the idea that Melbourne had “hidden” Smith’s behavioural problems from them. The Storm confirmed that nobody from the club had phoned them in the name of due diligence, which surprises considering they were signing a player on a deal worth upwards of $900,000 a season because of the ratchet clause that kicks in due to the salary cap increase.\n\nYou can’t help but wonder how Bennett is viewing this from afar.\n\nSmith met with him at Redcliffe Leagues Club midway through 2021. When reporters approached for comment, Smith dismissed his presence there with a funny grab: “I was just playing the pokies”.\n\nHe agreed to terms with the Dolphins on a deal worth $900,000 a season, only to fall for the Roosters’ charm offensive. The popular Sam Verrills was moved to the Gold Coast to fit Smith into the Roosters’ salary cap, while Bennett is still waiting for Smith to call and explain what happened.\n\nThe Roosters now find themselves in an invidious position: they have an underperforming and unreliable player, who his teammates aren’t thrilled about playing alongside, taking up a sizeable chunk of their salary cap until the end of next season.\n\nIt’s unlikely another club will want to take him unless the Roosters pay a significant part of his contract.\n\nThe best solution would be for Smith to regain the focus that saw him play the best football towards the end of last season as the Roosters surged into the finals. So far this year, it’s been bursts of 20 minutes here and there. He seems to run out of gas faster than any other forward.\n\nRoosters officials were angry about Smith discussing his breach in length on The Bye Round podcast earlier this week, although he sounded like a player who knew he’d pushed things too far.\n\n“I think you get three breaches [before being sacked],” Smith said. “It’s a warning but also a fine. If I get that second breach, I pay that fine. But you don’t want a second breach …”\n\nSmith, Politis and coach Trent Robinson declined requests for comment.\n\nNorth Queensland co-captain Reuben Cotter punishes rival forward packs every time he steps onto the field, whether it’s for his club, state or country.\n\nCanberra players might feel it a little more at GIO Stadium on Friday night when the 25-year-old honours his late uncle Dale for Beanie for Brain Cancer Round.\n\nCowboys forward Reuben Cotter with father Terry (left) and late uncle Dale (right).\n\nDale was diagnosed with an astrocytoma tumour in 2008 when he was just 24. He passed away in 2019, not long after watching Cotter make his NRL debut in a match against Manly in Townsville.\n\n“He was given a couple of years to live but lived for just over 10 years,” Cotter explains. “I was lucky enough to get him in the sheds after I made my debut. He couldn’t really speak too much by then, but you could tell from the look on his face how important it was for him. It was emotional for my whole family that night. Not long after that, he passed away.”\n\nNow in its 10th year, the Beanie for Brain Cancer Round has become an NRL institution, raising more than $30 million for the Mark Hughes Foundation that funds brain cancer research and patient support.\n\nMark Hughes delivers the match ball before the Sea Eagles-Roosters clash at Brookvale Oval last year.Credit: NRL Photos\n\nBrain cancer stats are frightening: survival rates have increased by only one per cent over the last 35 years; it kills more children under 10 than any other disease; it kills more adults under 40 than any other cancer; only two out of 10 people diagnosed live more than five years; it receives less than five per cent of federal funding for cancer research; one person every five hours is diagnosed in Australia.\n\n“It’s an important round, just not for us but everyone to raise awareness around brain cancer,” Cotter says. “It’s common and can sneak up on people. Dale was a healthy, fit, young man when he was diagnosed. He was important to our whole family and it’s a special round to honour him. He meant a lot to me and my footy.”\n\nDale is survived by his wife Rachael, son Drazic and daughter Lakita. He was a boilermaker in Mackay and heavily involved with rugby league in the region.\n\n“You would never know that he was sick because he always put on a brave face,” Cotter says. “He’d take the piss out of himself and make it easier for those around him. He was a very strong man. We miss him.”\n\nBeanies are available from all Lowes Australia stores, participating IGA Australia stores or online at www.markhughesfoundation.com.au\n\nTHE QUOTE“I feel this year Hawk-Eye has been a little bit off – I don’t know why.” — English tennis player Emma Raducanu after her first win on a grass court since 2022.

The official refugee team began competing at the 2016 Rio de Janeiro Games.\n\nLobalu took 10,000 gold late Wednesday in Rome, adding to his bronze in the 5,000 on Saturday, weeks after World Athletics allowed him to represent Switzerland despite not being a citizen.\n\n“He is currently not a Swiss national, which the Olympic Charter would require,” the International Olympic Committee said in a statement Thursday after its executive board declined to approve his eligibility six weeks before the Paris opening ceremony.\n\nLobalu, a refugee from South Sudan, has lived and trained in Switzerland since leaving the Olympic program in a dispute over controlling management of runners.\n\nLobalu later told Time magazine in an interview for an article published ahead of the Tokyo Olympics in 2021 that team management restricted runners’ ability to earn and keep the prize money from road races.\n\nHe said he rejected an offer to return to the program that could have let him make his Olympic debut in Tokyo.\n\nIn Tokyo that year, IOC officials acknowledged the criticism prompted a review of the refugee athlete program.\n\n\n\n\nThe IOC detailed on Thursday its invitation for Lobalu to add to the previously announced Olympic Refugee Team for Paris of 36 athletes from 11 countries in 12 sports.\n\n“He has the offer to compete in Paris, it’s perfectly possible,” IOC spokesman Mark Adams said. “Our rules are pretty clear. You need to have nationality of the country you are representing.”\n\nSwiss Olympic team officials explained to the IOC that it’s “very tough to obtain Swiss citizenship,” Adams said, with a minimum requirement of 10 years’ residency.\n\n___\n\nAP Olympics: https://apnews.com/hub/2024-paris-olympic-games\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCopyright 2025 The Associated Press.

Clark herself has now insisted she is not paying attention to the societal debates around her.\n\n'It's not something I can control so I don't put too much thought and time into thinking about things like that,' she said. 'To be honest, I don't see a lot of it.\n\n#IndianaFever’s Caitlin Clark on her name being weaponized in non-sports topics:“It’s not something I can control. … And to be honest, I don’t see a lot of it.”“People can talk about what they want to talk about. … I’m just here to play basketball.”Qs by @JimTrotter_NFL pic.twitter.com/VhGC7cIgLf\n\nCaitlin Clark insists the raging debate around her every move in the WNBA is not a distraction\n\nIt has been claimed Clark has been targeted in the WNBA for being 'straight and white'\n\n'Like I said, basketball is my job. Everything on the outside, I can't control that so I'm not going to spend time thinking about that.\n\n'People can talk about what they want to talk about, create conversations about whatever it is. But for myself, I am just there to play basketball.\n\n'I am trying to help my team win. We have won three games and I feel we have been in position to win more than that. My focus is on helping us do that.'\n\nQuizzed on if her status makes it hard to grow relationships in WNBA, she said: 'I think the league understands, one, we are excited about all things attention we are getting, we are appreciative of it.\n\n'The league has been great for a really long time. My focus is on my teammates, they have been amazing. I don't think it has impacted me making relationships on my team. \n\n'I'm not obviously talking to people on other teams on a daily basis. I have so much to focus on here, getting my teammates to trust me and do all that is my main focus - same with my coaching staff and this organization.'\n\nShe was then asked if she is bothered by people who 'attempt to weaponize your name', to which she responded: 'No, I don't see it. That is not where my focus is.\n\n'Again, my focus is here and on basketball. That is where it needs to be, where it has been and I am trying to get better on a daily basis.' \n\nClark says she ignores the narratives around her because it is out of her control \n\nThe No 1 pick in the WNBA Draft this year was controversially left out of the USA Olympic team\n\nWhitlock said at the weekend that Clark had been left off the Olympics roster because of the 'black gay mafia'.\n\nHe wrote on X: 'They/Thems Hate Cait. End of story.'\n\nHe continued in a separate post: 'Women's basketball decision-makers are not dumb. They've been bullied by the BLM-LGBTQIA+Silent P Alphabet Mafia bigots. \n\n'Same cowardice that built George Floyd statues, turned Juneteenth into a federal holiday, codified same-sex marriage, allows \"kid-friendly\" drag shows, let \"Lia Thomas\" swim... They keep making offers we don't refuse.'\n\nTravis, the founder of Outkick, spoke last week on Clark's incident with Carter, saying: 'It’s not just race though, it’s also sexuality. \n\n'Caitlin Clark is a white heterosexual woman in a black lesbian league and they resent and are jealous of all of the attention and the shoe deal that she got. \n\n'And instead of recognizing the truth, which is great athletes who people care about coming into your league really do get everybody more money.\n\n'They don’t like her cause she’s white and they don’t like her cause she’s straight.

(ABC News: Tom Maddocks)\n\nYual Reath has always wanted to make a name for himself.\n\n\"Just to let them know who I am. Tell them my story,\" he explains.\n\nAnd who is Yual Reath?\n\n\"I consider myself a weapon. The high jump king!\" he cheekily proclaims.\n\nReath's confidence belies a humble, hard-working landscape gardener from Ballarat who is now on the cusp of an Olympic dream.\n\nNineteen-year-old Claudia Hollingsworth enjoyed her \"best ever day\" as the breakout track star claimed both a national title and a spot in Australia's Olympics team within a few hours.\n\nThe 24-year-old has soared to new heights in 2024 and has almost certainly booked a spot for next month's Paris games in the men's high jump.\n\nBorn in South Sudan, there were few opportunities — Reath could either study, become a farmer or a soldier.\n\nAnd so his family moved to Egypt where they nervously waited for 18 months before being accepted by Australia when Reath was aged six.\n\nThey emigrated and settled in the regional Victorian city of Ballarat, alongside extended family.\n\n\"I had no gloves. I was just crying because my fingers were just frozen and I'd never seen snow before,\" he recalls.\n\nAs a teenager, Reath wanted to be a football or basketball star but his talent as a high jumper shone brighter.\n\n\"Just a young man, raw talent, amazing set of springs,\" says coach Paul Cleary.\n\nYual Reath achieved a height of 2.17m at the world titles in 2022, but this year the Australian is now clearing 2.30m. (Getty Images: Carmen Mandato)\n\n\"I've seen kids who have jumped before, I've been doing it for 45 years, so to see the natural ability to get off the ground was unbelievable.\"\n\nDespite Reath's initial reluctance, Cleary persisted, and it paid off when Reath began taking athletics seriously at 18 or 19.\n\n\"Probably the biggest game changer was the first time seeing my name on the Australian rankings. I was number 10, I was so excited,\" Reath says.\n\nTo earn money to prop up his burgeoning athletics career, Reath became an apprentice landscape gardener, toiling away during the day before high jumping at night.\n\nABC Sport is live blogging every day of the Paris Olympics\n\n\"It was tough because some days I was like, I just can't go to training because my body is just completely destroyed.\"\n\nThe manual labour was too much and in August he stopped landscaping and his performance on the track improved.\n\n\"When he stopped working full-time everything sort of fell into place for us,\" says Cleary.\n\n\"He was a bit more mobile at training, he wasn't turning up to training already exhausted.\"\n\nThis year, Reath won the Australian championships and has twice cleared a personal best of 2.30 metres, including winning a gold meet in Tokyo in May.\n\nLast week in Fiji, Reath claimed his first Oceania Championships title, clearing 2.28m to finish ahead of one of his main Australian rivals, Joel Baden.\n\nImportantly, the result in Suva pushes Reath into equal 10th in the world on ranking points, with 32 places available for Paris.\n\nThe Olympic qualification window closes at the end of this month and Australia can select three male high jumpers.\n\n\"It would mean the world (to represent Australia),\" Reath said.\n\n\"I personally believe that I could be the next generation of high jumpers, but I don't want to say it yet until I prove myself.\n\n\"So, I'm slowly just waiting until I crack them heights and get my name out there, and then I could be like, 'Yes, I am that man, I am that next generation of high jumpers.'\"\n\nReath's performances have been described as a revelation and his coach believes the 24-year-old is only getting started.\n\n\"Paris or not, the future's really bright for him,\" says Cleary.\n\n\"Most of (Reath's competitors) have got a 10-year head start on him.\n\n\"So I think our absolute best Olympics could be Brisbane in '32. He'll be 32 years old, he'll have all the experience in the world under his belt and he'll have a home crowd.\n\n\"(But) I can't count him out from having a red-hot crack at the medals in Paris.\"\n\nReath said he's ready to show the world he's the new kid on the block.\n\n\"When I jumped 2.30m it was just the beginning of the journey,\" he explained.\n\nThe eldest of four siblings, Reath is not just jumping for his country, he's also doing it for his family.\n\n\"Family is really important because we've been through the struggle. We did the massive journey just to find the place where we can live free.\"\n\nHe wants to make his hard-working mum proud.\n\n\"As she always says we're her future. I do everything with her in mind because I just want to succeed for her.\n\n\"I want to reward her, spoil her.

We go back to the trade deadline and we know Jacob Markstrom was really frustrated about all of the pubic talk about a possible deal from the Flames. Fair to say that that continues the frustration and grows at the uncertainty right now?\n\nCHRIS JOHNSTON: Well there’s definitely a level of that, and I’m sure he’s not even going to like that we’re addressing it right here, right now so I recognize that we’re part of the problem. But look, the timing of how this all plays out, I do think, will be interesting, and right now it does seem as though we’re not seeing trades around the league picking up just yet, obviously with the Stanley Cup Final still ongoing, but if this drags a little bit longer I can’t imagine his mood or anyone else’s will get better. The Flames are at the point where they feel they have to get a certain return to make this deal. You can fully understand that given who Jacob Markstrom is, how accomplished he is. The New Jersey Devils remain the team I think is most highly motivated to try to get a trade done. But there’s only so far they’re going, so I think in the middle here you have a goaltender with a no movement clause, who I think would like to move sooner than later if that is at all possible, because he’s got two years left on his deal and it’s a big move for him and his family.\n\nDARREN DREGER: You know, ample speculation with a couple of other Canadian franchises, as well. I’m looking at Toronto and I’m looking at the Winnipeg Jets. The whirlwind that continues to swirl around Mitch Marner seems endless, but really nothing has changed on that file. Marner has another year remaining on his contract with the Toronto Maple Leafs, and he intends to play it out, so maybe we’re having this conversation heading into July 1, 2025?\n\nDUTHIE: Every week next season likely on Insider Trading, Tuesdays and Thursdays.\n\nDREGER: That’s an absolute given, but that doesn’t mean that Brad Treliving and the Toronto Maple Leafs can’t have conversations and explore possibilities. But as we have this conversation, the focus for Marner is training in the offseason and getting ready to come back to camp in Toronto. And then you’ve got Winnipeg, and a lot of speculation around one of their veteran forwards, and that’s Nikolaj Ehlers. He too, is going into the final year of his contract, and I know that general manager Kevin Cheveldayoff is at least open to having conversations with interested general managers. I think of the Carolina Hurricanes, potentially the connection there with Marty Necas also in play. But this is more of a financial issue for the Winnipeg Jets. Yeah, they’d like to keep Nikolaj Ehlers and extend him, but they’ve Kyle Connor who has two years left on his deal, and he is going to be a big money ticket. So, the speculation in Toronto and Winnipeg will continue until further notice.\n\nDUTHIE: In Columbus, is it a mutual agreement now that they are going to move on from Patrik Laine and that he’ll be traded?\n\nPIERRE LEBRUN: That’s the goal from everyone involved. We know that Patrik Laine entered the player assistance program, had the courage to seek help and he’s still in the program right now. So, we have to consider that factor. But, he would like to move on. His agent has had conversation with the Blue Jackets about it, and both sides are going to work together to try and get that done. He wants a fresh start, it hasn’t been a good time in Columbus. Two more years at $8.7 million a year, let’s see how big that market is, but we know what the potential is.\n\nDUTHIE: And Dregs mentioned Necas, the latest there?\n\nLEBRUN: Well, they’ve heard from basically every team in the league, and what they’ve tried to do is narrow down the realistic possibilities for a potential trade. I’m told five to seven teams invite intriguing possibilities for the Hurricanes, but no one’s gone up to the price that they’d like to see. Winnipeg, you mentioned, Chicago, Boston, and Montreal among the teams that have inquired.\n\nDUTHIE: And we’ve known for more than 24 hours that Leon Draisaitl was not going to be suspended for his hit on Barkov, but I don’t know that we really got an explanation why. Why?\n\nJOHNSTON: Well look, when the Department of Player Safety looked at this, I don’t think anyone in the room or that is part of those conversations liked the hit, they saw there was a bit of an elbow, obviously he left his feet, and in this case Barkov misses half a period. But, you look at where we are, we’re at the Stanley Cup Final, I think ultimately they want to look at how they got to where it’s no suspension, it certainly doesn’t hurt that Barkov appears to be healthy, but also the fact that the standard does go up. The cost of what a Game 3 of the Cup Final would be is pretty significant, and so ultimately that has Leon Draisaitl eligible for Game 3.\n\nDUTHIE: Finally, originally Hockey Canada said they were going to make two different coaching decisions for the two big international events coming up, the Four Nations and then the Olympics. Has that changed and do they have one guy?\n\nLEBRUN: Or at least they wanted to give themselves time if it was going to be the same person to wait and see, but there will be no wait and see. The likely candidate, we believe will be Jon Cooper, will get both gigs, the Four Nations and the Olympics. And listen, I think in the conversations between Jon Cooper, who was at the World Championships hanging out with Team Canada people last month,  was that, well, is this guy really going to audition at the Four Nations for the Olympics? I don’t think so, so everyone took a second thought at this and said, “Yeah, let’s just name Jon Cooper.” It should happen after the Stanley Cup Final.\n\nDUTHIE: And you’d think Paul Maurice would get consideration somewhere on that staff considering the last couple of years that he’s had, as well.\n\n© 2025\n\n All rights reserved.\n            "

And, as she lay in her bed before the European 800m final, one question went through her head. Can I run?\n\nIt was a decision she left to the wire. But after a warm-up that involved loading up on First Defence, Aspirin, paracetamol and vitamin C, the brilliant 22-year-old decided to roll the dice. It was a move of guts and glory as she went from her sick bed to the top of the podium.\n\nIt was not pretty. It was not fast. But she found a way. On the final straight Slovakia’s Gabriela Gajanova threatened an almighty upset, but Hodgkinson dug deep to win in 1min 58.65sec. Her margin of victory? Just 0.14sec. No wonder she puffed her cheeks out at the end.\n\n“It not been the greatest 24 hours,” Hodgkinson admitted. “I felt a little bit of a sore throat and sniffles yesterday in the warm-up. And then it got worse. I was lying in bed, thinking can I run?”\n\nHodgkinson was such an overwhelming favourite that a £33 bet on her to win would have yielded just a £1 profit. Yet such odds did not appear entirely crazy given the Briton’s personal best was three seconds clear of the field.\n\nYet few outside the British team knew that Hodgkinson was ill. In fact it was only in the call room, right before going on to the track, that she decided to run. Afterwards she agreed that her status as Europe’s best 800m runner had helped her to rope-a-dope her rivals.\n\n“Sometimes when you are racing, you’ve got to think as much as you are nervous, they are also nervous to race you as well,” she said. “But I had to believe in the fact that I am the defending champion.\n\n“I would have liked a better time but it was just about finding a way to win,” she added.\n\n“You do think how much worse is it going to make me in two hours when I crash. But hopefully it has been worth it.”\n\nThere was a second gold for Britain on the final night of these championships as the women’s 4x100m team laid down a significant marker for the Olympics.\n\nDina Asher-Smith got Britain off to a flying start before a smooth hand over to Desiree Henry. Amy Hunt increased the lead before Daryll Neita brought the victory home in 41.91sec.\n\n“It felt absolutely amazing,” said Neita, who admitted she was disappointed to only win women’s 200m silver on Tuesday. “It was a bit bitter sweet and then this morning, the ladies really picked me up. To finish the championships with a gold medal with these amazing ladies, it’s just an incredible feeling, really electric and I really have a good feeling going into Paris.”\n\nSign up to The Recap\n\nThe best of our sports journalism from the past seven days and a heads-up on the weekend’s action\n\nafter newsletter promotion\n\nAsher-Smith agreed, adding: “We’ve got such a deep squad and so many amazing athletes, we are just trying things out. That was great, it was so slick and so smooth.”\n\nElsewhere Jakob Ingebrigtsen sent out a warning to Josh Kerr as he defended his 1500m title in a championship record 3:31.95. The Norwegian took the lead after 600m and controlled the race before winning by 10 metres. No wonder he held one finger in the air like an emperor after completing the ‘triple double’ of 1500m and 5,000m gold in the last three European Championships.\n\nAnother reigning world champion, Mondo Duplantis, also looked hugely impressive as he cleared a championship record 6.10m – before narrowly missing out on the world record of 6.25m.\n\nThere was also a sensational performance from Germany’s Malaika Mihambo, whose huge 7.22m world leading distance gave her long jump gold ahead of Italy’s Larissa Iapichino.\n\nEarlier in the evening there was a second gold medal for the Dutch star Femke Bol as the Netherlands won the 4x400m relay in 3:22.39 ahead of Ireland, who took silver in a national record of 3:22.71.\n\nAll in all it was a highly enjoyable championships, especially on the final two nights when the crowds came out in force. And it was only appropriate that the final event on the track ended with a dominant Italy victory in the men’s 4x100m.\n\nIt meant they finished these championships with a record 24 medals, including 11 golds. Britain ended up third overall with 13 medals, including four golds, four silvers and five bronzes."

West worked for the Clippers as a consultant for the past seven years.\n\nHe was an All-Star in all 14 of his NBA seasons, a 12-time All-NBA selection, part of the 1972 Lakers team that won a championship, an NBA Finals MVP when the Lakers lost to the Boston Celtics in 1969 — the first year that award was given out, and still the only time it went to a player on the losing team — and was selected as part of the NBA’s 75th anniversary team.\n\nWest was general manager of championship teams with the Los Angeles Lakers, helping build the “Showtime” dynasty.\n\nHe also worked in the front offices of the Memphis Grizzlies, the Golden State Warriors and the Clippers. Among his many highlights as an executive with the Lakers: he drafted Magic Johnson and James Worthy, then brought in Kobe Bryant and eventually Shaquille O'Neal to play alongside Bryant.\n\nHis basketball life bridged generations: West played with Elgin Baylor, whom he called “the most supportive and the greatest player of that era,” and Wilt Chamberlain. As a coach and executive, he worked with a who's-who of NBA stars from the past 40 years: Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, Johnson, Worthy, O'Neal, Bryant, Stephen Curry, Klay Thompson, Kevin Durant, Kawhi Leonard and Paul George among them.\n\n“I marvel at them, at the joy they brought basketball fans all over the world,” West said in 2019.\n\nEven in the final years of his life, West was considered basketball royalty. He routinely sat courtside at Summer League games in Las Vegas, often watching many games in a day while greeting long lines of players — LeBron James among them — who would approach to shake his hand.\n\n“The game transcends many things,” West said while attending Summer League last year. “The players change, the style of play may change, but the respect that you learn in this game never changes.”\n\nJames, on social media, offered his condolences: “Will truly miss our convos my dear friend! My thoughts and prayers goes out to your wonderful family! Forever love Jerry! Rest in Paradise my guy!” the NBA's all-time scoring leader wrote.\n\nWest is 25th on the NBA's all-time scoring list, and while the league has never confirmed that West was in fact the model for its logo — a player dribbling a ball, set against a red-and-blue background — the league has never said otherwise, either.\n\n“While it’s never been officially declared that the logo is Jerry West,” Silver said in 2021, “it sure looks a lot like him.”\n\nWest is still the NBA Finals' all-time leader in total points, along with field goals made and attempted as well as free throws made and attempted. He played in the title series nine times with the Lakers; his teams went 1-2 against the New York Knicks, and 0-6 against the Celtics.\n\n“Those damn Celtics,” he often said.\n\nWest also hit one of the most famed shots in finals history, a 60-footer at the buzzer of game three of the 1970 series between the Knicks and Lakers to force overtime.\n\nTributes from across the sports world quickly poured in after news broke of West's death. The Los Angeles Dodgers released a statement calling West “an indelible figure on the Los Angeles sports landscape for more than 60 years,” and the NBA was planning a pregame tribute to West before Game 3 of the NBA Finals between the Celtics and Dallas Mavericks.\n\n“Jerry West is one of my favorite people that I had the honor to get to know in the NBA,” Miami Heat managing general partner Micky Arison said. “He welcomed me to the league, offered advice from the first day, and asked nothing in return. He will be missed.”\n\nMichael Jordan said he considered West “a friend and mentor - like an older brother to me.”\n\n“I valued his friendship and knowledge,” Jordan said. “I always wished I could have played against him as a competitor, but the more I came to know him, I wish I had been his teammate. I admired his basketball insights and he and I shared many similarities to how we approached the game.”\n\n9 minutes ago\n\n21 minutes ago\n\n49 minutes ago\n\n© 2025 Nine Entertainment Co."

And he did have a prolific season. If anyone, at least to start the season, it looked like Jude Bellingham would be the protagonist. Tactically, he was a focal point, but he never quite stole the show when it was all said and done.\n\nNow, without a doubt, their anti-hero has arrived in Kylian Mbappe.\n\nAnd that raises questions of how Barcelona will match his footballing prowess. \n\nFor years, bright new faces have come long for Barcelona, seemingly out of no where.\n\nFirst, it was Ansu Fati. He even inherited the number ten from Messi. Perhaps that was too much too soon.\n\nAnd then came Pedri, who in his debut season, became a global phenomenon.  \n\nCertainly the best thing to come out of Ronald Koeman’s tenure, Pedri played more minutes than any other Barcelona player. Then he went on to do the same thing for the Spanish national team over the summer at Euro 2020 and the Olympics.  No rest for such a young, and able bodied prodigy.\n\nNo one saved Pedri from himself. And he paid the price.\n\nHe did feature for Spain at the World Cup in 2022, but didn’t play from them again, until now, because of an unending injury history.\n\nBut Pedri is back baby.\n\nHe scored twice against Northern Ireland in a warm up for the big tournament, and looks poised to be the leader that Spain will need in order to make a big run.\n\nWhen you look at the Spanish roster, your reaction may very well be, meh. \n\nAbove average. Nice technical players. But like Barcelona itself, nothing that will strike fear into the hearts of opponents.\n\nUnless the Pedri of old makes a comeback.\n\nAnd frankly, if he’s joined by a confident and effective Lamine Yamal, maybe just maybe, Spain can be a contender.\n\nAnd if that goes well, there will be reason for excitement for Hansi Flick and company.\n\nOf all the uncertainties and challenges that Flick will face, I have to imagine one of the big reasons he wanted to come to Barcelona in the first place was to work with, develop, have success with the corps of young, talented players.\n\nWe all love Gavi and Fermin Lopez. We all know what Frenkie de Jong and Ilkay Gundogan are capable of.\n\nBut the the one with the biggest ceiling is Pedri. He is the number ten. The man with the magic feet. Cut from the Barcelona cloth, destined to be the next midfield legend.\n\nHe has the talent. He has the desire.\n\nBut will Pedri’s body allow him to meet or surpass the great expectations we all have for him?\n\nNo doubt, Barcelona will be eagerly looking to build a staff, and get the right practices into place, to do a much better job of preventing injuries, and getting players with an injury record back to full strength.\n\nIn addition to Pedri, there will be big questions asked of Gavi and Alejandro Balde when they make their returns.\n\nBut for me, this is the summer of Pedri.\n\nI’ll be watching to see what Lamine and Fermin can do. But I’ll be watching even more closely to see if Pedri is getting back to his best.\n\nThe answer to that question will be a preview of what Barcelona can accomplish in the season ahead.\n\n\n\n\n\nCheck your inbox for a welcome email.\n\nOops.

Transgender swimmer Lia Thomas failed in her challenge against rules that stop her competing in elite women’s races because judges ruled she did not have standing to bring the case. The Court of Arbitration for Sport said Wednesday, June 12, 2024, its panel of three judges dismissed Thomas’ request for arbitration with the World Aquatics governing body. (AP Photo/John Bazemore, File)\n\nTransgender swimmer Lia Thomas failed in her challenge against rules that stop her from competing in elite women’s races because judges ruled she did not have standing to bring the case.\n\nThe Court of Arbitration for Sport panel of three judges dismissed Thomas’ request for arbitration with the World Aquatics governing body, in a ruling released Wednesday.\n\nWorld Aquatics banned transgender women who have been through male puberty from competing in women’s races. It also created an “open” category for which transgender athletes would be eligible.\n\nThomas had asked the sports court in Switzerland to overturn the rules approved in 2022 that she said were invalid, unlawful and discriminatory.\n\nThomas called the CAS’ decision “deeply disappointing” in a statement provided by her legal team. “Blanket bans preventing trans women from competing are discriminatory and deprive us of valuable athletic opportunities that are central to our identities.” Thomas said the decision should be viewed as a call to action for trans women to ”fight for our dignity and human rights.”\n\nAthlete Ally founder and executive director Hudson Taylor called it a “sad day for sports and for anyone who believes that trans athletes should have the opportunity for their experiences of discrimination to be heard and adjudicated like everyone else.” \n\nGay & Lesbian Alliance Against Defamation (GLAAD) president/CEO Sarah Kate Ellis said in a statement that Thomas deserves a chance to participate in her sport like all human beings who work hard and follow their dream.\n\n\n\n\n“World Aquatics continues to spread disinformation about transgender people as a distorted way to ‘protect women,’” Ellis added. ”Transgender women are women and all athletes who want to play and follow the rules should have a chance to do so.”\n\nThomas swam for the University of Pennsylvania and won an NCAA title in meets that are outside the World Aquatics competitive system, in which she was not registered.\n\nThe world swim body argued to CAS that Thomas was not a member of its member federation USA Swimming when the legal case was started. She also had not competed in female events “for the purpose of qualification or selection” for World Aquatics competitions, such as the Olympics or world championships.\n\n“The panel concludes that she lacks standing to challenge the policy and the operational requirements in the framework of the present proceeding,” the court said in its ruling.\n\nIn January, the ruling said, USA Swimming granted her request for “self-identity verification” as part of its policy on athlete inclusion.\n\nThe judges said USA Swimming had no authority “to modify such scope of application” of the world governing body’s rules.\n\nWorld Aquatics said it welcomed the CAS decision in a case “we believe is a major step forward in our efforts to protect women’s sport.”\n\n“World Aquatics is dedicated to fostering an environment that promotes fairness, respect, and equal opportunities for athletes of all genders and we reaffirm this pledge,” the governing body based in Lausanne said in a statement.\n\nSwimming’s policy on transgender athletes was followed by other top-tier Olympic sports, track and field, then cycling, in excluding from women’s events those who have potentially gained lasting physical advantages from male puberty.\n\nThe International Cycling Union noted last year “it is also impossible to rule out the possibility that biomechanical factors such as the shape and arrangement of the bones in their limbs may constitute a lasting advantage for female transgender athletes.”\n\nThomas was represented at CAS by Toronto-based Tyr, the legal firm that has represented two-time Olympic champion runner Caster Semenya. Semenya is excluded from running in her specialist 800-meter event by World Athletics rules on athletes with differences in sex development who have elevated levels of testosterone.\n\nThe CAS judges declined World Aquatics’ request for Thomas to pay its legal costs and other expenses incurred in the case.\n\nThe judging panel included two of the highest-profile CAS arbitrators: Thomas selected Richard McLaren, the Canadian investigator who helped prove the Russian doping scandal at the Sochi Olympics; and World Aquatics chose Ulrich Haas, a German law professor who helped judge celebrated cases involving Manchester City and Grand Slam tennis champion Simona Halep.\n\nThe CAS panel, which held a hearing in March, was chaired by a Paris-based Spanish arbitrator Carmen Núñez-Lagos.\n\nThe ruling was dated Monday, five days before the U.S. trials meet for the Paris Olympics starts in Indianapolis.\n\n___\n\nAP Paris Olympics: https://apnews.com/hub/2024-paris-olympic-games\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCopyright 2025 The Associated Press.

Rafael Nadal and Carlos Alcaraz will team up to represent Spain in the men’s doubles event at this year’s upcoming Olympic Games in Paris.\n\nAfter months of speculation, Spain’s Olympic tennis captain David Ferrer today confirmed what many in Spain and beyond had been hoping to hear for some time – two of the biggest names in the sport will unite to form an inter-generational doubles team to be reckoned with.\n\nIt is a major coup both for Spanish sport and the Paris Olympics, as the marketing of the tennis event will be made much easier with the added prospect of watching Nadal and Alcaraz play alongside each other acting as a powerful incentive for potential spectators.\n\nOn the court, while 38-year-old Nadal and 21-year-old Alcaraz have never played doubles together on tour, the pair possess a joint clay-court pedigree that will be a frightening prospect for their opponents in Paris.\n\nEs oficial: ¡Rafa y Carlitos juntos en @Paris2024! 🔥🎾@DavidFerrer87, capitán del equipo español, confirmó que Nadal-Alcaraz será una de las parejas de dobles en los #JuegosOlímpicos. 🇪🇸 🤯¡Qué ganas de verlos en acción! 🎉 #RoadToParis2024 I @COE_es @RFETenis pic.twitter.com/vFWrBjGFEn\n\nNadal is a 14-time Roland-Garros champion, while Alcaraz has just won his first title at the same competition in only his fourth main-draw appearance.\n\nThey are both supreme clay-courters, who bring very different attributes to the tennis court.\n\nWith three Grand Slam titles already under his belt, current world No 2 Alcaraz will be hoping to add another prestigious feather to his cap at the Olympics this year as he enters both the singles and the doubles as one of the favourites for the gold medal.\n\nNadal, meanwhile, is competing in his final Olympics and will be hoping to sign off his extraordinary career at the Games with yet more success on the clay courts of Paris.\n\nThe 22-time Grand Slam champion is already an Olympic gold medallist in the singles (in 2008) and in the doubles (in 2016).\n\nWatching the pair compete together on clay this summer should be some spectacle.\n\n\"*\" indicates required fields\n\nSpain\n\nSpain\n\nYour email address will not be published.

(AP Photo/Tony Gutierrez)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe sport of cricket is as foreign to most Americans as driving on the left-hand side of the road or drinking warm beer.\n\nThis year, though, the United States is getting a close-up view of the bat-and-ball sport originally from England that resembles a cockeyed version of baseball where the pitcher purposely bounces the ball in front of the batter.\n\nThe U.S. national cricket team — which dates to at least 1844 — has already made a dent in the hierarchy of the game by beating Pakistan last week at the Twenty20 World Cup, which is being held in New York, Texas, Florida and six other venues dotted around the Caribbean.\n\nThe team’s next game is set for Wednesday against India on Long Island, about an hour outside New York. The Americans aren’t expected to win that one, but neither were they expected to beat Pakistan — a traditional powerhouse that reached the final at the last T20 World Cup in 2022.\n\n“We know that we really and truly want to get the word out there as it relates to cricket in the country for the American born and raised people,” said Aaron Jones, the American team’s top batter. “I think the further we go in the tournament, the better for us, and the better for us bringing fans on board.”\n\nStill, similar to the match against Pakistan, the Americans can expect the other team to get the bulk of the crowd support on Wednesday at the temporary Nassau County International Cricket Stadium.\n\n\n\n\nThe South Asian diaspora, like most people back in their homelands, is wild about cricket. They certainly turned out on Sunday for the highly anticipated match between India and Pakistan at the same venue, located not far from immigrant-heavy neighborhoods in Queens and Brooklyn. \n\n“I think the crowd will be supporting both teams, to be honest,” Jones said Tuesday. “We have a lot of Indian players on our team as well. So, I think the crowd will be supporting both teams.”\n\nAlthough the United States is known for playing in the very first international cricket match against Canada in 1844, the sport declined in participation through the decades while baseball — a pastime more similar to the game of rounders with players running around bases rather than just back and forth — flourished on these shores.\n\nIt’s making a comeback, though. Cricket was added to the Olympic program for the 2028 Los Angeles Games, the first time the sport will be played at the event since the 1900 Paris Games.\n\n“With cricket being one of the biggest sports in the world, it’s only a matter of time before the majority of people come on board as it relates to American born and raised people,” Jones said. “I think America is a place where people love sports and obviously this World Cup is going to open the eyes of a lot of people, and then in a few years obviously with cricket being in the Olympics, that’s a very big thing as well.”\n\nThere’s also a professional Twenty20 circuit in the United States that started play last year. Major League Cricket’s second season is set to open on July 5 with six teams.\n\nTwenty20 cricket is the shortest of the three main forms of the game. Each team is at bat for 20 overs (about 120 pitched balls, or six pitches per over) or until the fielding team gets 10 of the 11 opposing players out. One-day cricket expands that to 50 overs for each team, while test cricket is an unlimited amount of overs with each side batting twice. A test match — the most revered form of the game — can last up to five days, with breaks for lunch and tea during the eight-or-so-hour daily sessions.\n\nTeams in cricket score significantly more runs than in baseball. The Americans, for example, piled up 159 runs against Pakistan to tie the score after the 20 overs were completed and then won in a super over — the equivalent of an extra inning in baseball.\n\nThe U.S. team is made up of players with roots in the hotbeds of the sport, including India, Pakistan, South Africa and the Caribbean. They know their wickets from their stumps, their centuries from their dot balls and their pace from their spin, even if most of their countrymen don’t.\n\nThey also know what they are up against on Wednesday facing the likes of Virat Kohli and Rohit Sharma, two of the biggest stars in cricket.\n\n“Me growing up as a kid, I always wanted to play against the best players in the world, and I’m definitely going to get the opportunity to do that now,” Jones said. “I don’t want to say intimidating. I’m excited to play against them, to talk to them, and definitely to beat them as well.”\n\nSo far at the T20 World Cup, the United States defeated Canada in its opening Group A game and then downed Pakistan on Thursday. If the team falls against India, the Americans will need to beat Ireland on Friday to have a chance of advancing to the Super 8 — the next stage with the eight quarterfinalists split into two groups of four.\n\nPakistan, however, put itself back in the mix by beating Canada on Tuesday. If Pakistan beats Ireland on Sunday, it could go down to a somewhat complicated set of tiebreakers to decide if the Americans advance to the next round.\n\n“Right now, we are focused on playing India tomorrow,” Jones said, “and then whatever happens after that ... we’ll deal with it.”\n\n___\n\nAP cricket: https://apnews.com/hub/cricket\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCopyright 2025 The Associated Press.

She proved to be a star in her field early on and won a silver medal in the U10 race at the Community Games in Mosney while running bare foot. \n\nA post shared by Sharlene Mawdsley. (@sharlenem1)\n\nProving that she has no shortage of talent and brains, Sharlene's success on the track is matched by her accomplishments in the classroom. \n\nShe attended the University of Limerick where she achieved a BA in Sociology and New Media and won medals for her university at the Irish Universities indoor and outdoor championships.\n\nIt was her competitive urge that pushed her to take up running over team sports like soccer, which Sharlene admits she dropped because she hated when she wasn't always part of the action.\n\nShe burst onto the scene in 2021 when she competed in the women's 400 metre event at the European Athletics Indoor Championships and has four indoor and two outdoor titles to her name.  \n\nThese days she is coached by former Olympian Gary Ryan. \n\nSharlene trains five days a week and previously gave insight into how she prepares for a big competition telling The Speed Project: 'I listen to all the advice my coaches give me and focus on my weaknesses but also strengths. \n\n'It's good to know what you're good at as it may be someone else's weakness. \n\nA post shared by Sharlene Mawdsley. (@sharlenem1)\n\n'On the weeks leading into the competition, I try to eat a little healthier than usual but I'm not too strict. And of course, on the day of the competition, I listen to music and try to get as much sugar in my body as possible.' \n\nSpeaking of sugar, Sharlene admitted that she definitely has a sweet tooth and that her favourite treat is chocolate. \n\nA post shared by Sharlene Mawdsley. (@sharlenem1)\n\nSharlene tends to keep her personal life to herself but definitely makes the most of the time she spends abroad with the sport and has posted snaps of herself exploring in Bratislava in Slovakia, the Netherlands and Corfu in Greece on top of her own trips. \n\n\n\n"

The team includes seven players from the group that won gold in Tokyo – the seventh straight for the US.\n\nSelection committee chair Jen Rizzotti said the committee was aware of the outside noise and pressure to select Clark, the No 1 pick in the WNBA draft who has drawn millions of new fans to the sport but has struggled at times during her first year as a professional.\n\n“Here’s the basketball criteria that we were given as a committee and how do we evaluate our players based on that?” Rizzotti said. “And when you base your decision on criteria, there were other players that were harder to cut because they checked a lot more boxes.

Her Olympic career started when she was a WNBA rookie in the 2004 Athens Games. Other returnees from the Tokyo Olympics are Breanna Stewart, A’ja Wilson, Chelsea Gray, Napheesa Collier, Jewell Loyd and Brittney Griner.\n\nThe US also added newcomers Kelsey Plum and Jackie Young, who helped the US win the inaugural 3x3 gold medal at the Tokyo Games in 2021. Alyssa Thomas, Sabrina Ionescu and Kahleah Copper will join the team as first-time Olympians. All three played on the US team that won the World Cup in Australia in 2022.\n\n“It’s a great mix of talent across the board in terms of individual skill sets,” USA Basketball CEO Jim Tooley said. “We have veterans, newcomers and those in the middle. Good perspective and continuity is such an important thing and is why we’ve been successful in the Olympics.”\n\nAll 12 of those players have senior national team experience. Clark does not.\n\n“She’s certainly going to continue to get better and better,” Tooley said. “Really hope that she’s a big part of our future going forward.”\n\nThe selection committee has a set of criteria to pick the team that includes playing ability, position and adaptability to the international game. Marketing and popularity aren’t on that list.\n\n“It would be irresponsible for us to talk about her in a way other than how she would impact the play of the team,” Rizzotti said. “Because it wasn’t the purview of our committee to decide how many people would watch or how many people would root for the US. It was our purview to create the best team we could for Cheryl.”"

Even though Pedri is still young he broke out at a similar age as Yamal three years ago, and just like Lamine now was Spain’s big hope for the European championships.\n\nWhen asked if his experience could be used as an advice for Lamine, Pedri said there’s not much that needs to be explained to Yamal who is wise beyond his years and poised for, according to Pedri, a great tournament.\n\n“A piece of advice for Lamine? He doesn’t need it. He only thinks about playing football and having fun on the pitch. I’m sure he’ll play a great tournament.”\n\nSource: Barça Times\n\nWe all hope Yamal does indeed have a great run in the Euros, but what comes next is what’s most important. Spain essentially ruined the next three years of Pedri’s career by making him play in the Olympics and have zero vacation time before coming back to his club duties, and the same mistake cannot be made with someone just as promising in Lamine.\n\nSo go wreck shop in Euro 2024, Lamine Yamal.

You remember that and, you know, hopefully in four years, when four years comes back around … I can be there,” she said.\n    \n\n\n            However, USA Basketball has made a “terrible decision,” according to CNN Sport analyst Christine Brennan, by omitting a phenomenon like Clark from the roster.\n    \n\n\n            From a P.R. perspective, it probably made sense for Clark to make the team. Yet, watching Clark’s teething problems in her first month in the league and going over her early season statistics, her omission perhaps should not have come as a surprise.\n    \n\n\n            The physicality of the WNBA has been one her biggest struggles early on and international basketball certainly isn’t any less intense.\n    \n\n\n            Part of Clark’s highlight reel so far have been images of the slight point guard picking herself up off the court. She’s been on the receiving end of several hard fouls, including some that were whistled as flagrant.\n    \n\n\n            “I think at this point I know I’m going to take a couple of hard shots a game and that’s what it is,” Clark said after a recent game against the Chicago Sky.\n    \n\n\n            “I’m trying not to let it bother me.”\n    \n\n\n            Understandably, Clark is commanding more attention from opponent defenses than perhaps any other player in the league, but she has yet to find a way to consistently break down those tactics.\n    \n\n\n            Through 13 games so far, Clark’s 70 turnovers are by some distance the most of any player in the league and her average of 5.4 turnovers a game is well clear of Alyssa Thomas’s 4.3 in second place.\n    \n\n\n            Clark is also shooting just 37.3% from the floor and 33% from three, which is arguably her greatest weapon, and it seems unlikely that the Indiana Fever would command any less attention from opponents on the Olympic stage.\n    \n\n\n            On statistics alone, then, it is difficult to justify Clark’s inclusion; though by the same metrics, Diana Taurasi’s inclusion is even more difficult to explain given she is averaging just 16.6 points on just 37.1% shooting, while contributing fewer rebounds, assists and steals per game.\n    \n\n\n            Through 13 games this season, the Indiana Fever’s defensive rating of 111.7 is by far the worst in the league, with Clark’s individual defensive struggles at the forefront.\n    \n\n\n            Breanna Stewart, a two-time WNBA champion, Brittney Griner, a nine-time All Star and A’ja Wilson, a two-time MVP, have all represented Team USA at an Olympic Games before. Even the 42-year-old Taurasi, a five-time Olympic champion who has largely played poorly so far this season, has been included in part for her vast experience.\n    \n\n\n            Plus, there are many talented players Clark is up against for the guard position.\n    \n\n\n            Clark would also have been by some distance the youngest and most inexperienced player on the team. Aged 26, Sabrina Ionescu and Jackie Young are the youngest to be selected, but both are already multi-time All-Stars.\n    \n\n\n            Additionally, Clark has barely had time to take a breath over the past couple of seasons, leading Iowa to back-to-back NCAA championship games and after the draft almost immediately entering training camp with the Fever ahead of her WNBA debut.\n    \n\n\n             Only two players this season have played more minutes than Clark, experienced duo Stewart and Betnijah Laney-Hamilton.\n    \n\n\n            Long term, for both Clark and the league, a few weeks’ rest could be for the best.\n    \n\n\n            The 22-year-old said it’s “going to be really nice” to have some time off during the Olympics, with the WNBA pausing during the Games.\n    \n\n\n            “I’ve loved competing every single second, but it’s going to be a great month for my body,” she told reporters after Fever practice on Sunday. “First of all, get rest and get healthy and just get a little time away from basketball and the craziness of everything that’s been going on. Just find some peace and quiet for myself.”\n    \n\n\n            Brennan added that team politics may also have contributed to the decision.\n    \n\n\n            “I have two sources, impeccable sources, who said that they had heard from various people that a concern was that if Caitlin was put on the team but only got a few minutes of playing time, which would be logical for a rookie on a great team that last lost in 1992 – the best, most dominant team in sports - that all of her fans would be upset and would be, I guess, just storming the gates and on radio shows and on social media,” she told World Sport’s Don Riddell.\n    \n\n\n            “I couldn’t believe my ears that that was a discussion topic in the meetings about the reaction to Caitlin Clark,” added Brennan.\n    \n\n\n            “And is it a situation where we heard chilly comments from Diana Taurasi and Breanna Stewart at the women’s Final Four? I asked Diana Taurasi’s agent point-blank: ‘Can you point me to anything positive she’s ever said about Caitlin Clark?’ Never heard back, gave the agent a week to reply, and both of those women are on the team.”\n    \n\n\n            Stewart had said Clark, the all-time scoring leader in men’s and women’s NCAA Division I history, needed to win a national title to be considered one of the greats in women’s college basketball history, while Taurasi said she would take Paige Bueckers, who wasn’t in the 2024 WNBA draft, as the No. 1 overall pick over Clark.\n    \n\n\n            Both Stewart and Taurasi later attempted to clarify that their comments about Clark at the Final Four were not intended to be negative.\n    \n\n\n            CNN has approached USA Basketball for comment.\n    \n\n\n            In an interview with AP on Tuesday, USA Basketball Women’s selection committee chair Jennifer Rizzotti said: “It would be irresponsible for us to talk about her [Clark] in a way other than how she would impact the play of the team.\n    \n\n\n            “Because it wasn’t the purview of our committee to decide how many people would watch or how many people would root for the U.S. It was our purview to create the best team we could for Cheryl [Reeve].”\n    \n\n\n            On the flip side, however, Brennan says Clark’s omission is hard to explain if USA Basketball is interested in exposure and growing women’s basketball.\n    \n\n\n            “She’s the biggest thing in sports, not just women’s basketball in the United States,” Brennan said of why Clark should be included. “I mean, literally very, very likely the best-known athlete in the country right now.\n    \n\n\n            “Because she’s playing great. Because she represents the college side of the game … and because she can help them win. Especially three-pointers in the international game are a must and she’s an excellent player.\n    \n\n\n            “Her stats are better than Diana Taurasi, who will be on the team for her sixth run at an Olympic gold medal, and so the bottom line is she brings eyeballs.”\n    \n\n\n            According to the WNBA, the 2024 season opened with the highest attendance in 26 years and the most watched games in history on national television, a boom fuelled in no small part by interest in Clark. The former Iowa star’s professional debut in May drew the largest WNBA audience in two decades.\n    \n\n\n            Having Clark on the team could arguably have helped grow the women’s game globally, giving fans from around the world a better chance to see a phenomenon in action.\n    \n\n\n            How many tickets were bought by those hoping to see Clark on the court? How many more would have tuned in to watch to find out for themselves why America is so enthralled by this generational talent?\n    \n\n\n            “You will have the world watching. It will grow women’s sports. There’ll be kids in Africa and Europe who will see number 22 and want to buy the jersey and who would watch - and then maybe go out and shoot baskets,” Brennan added.\n    \n\n\n            “An empowering moment for girls and women that has been totally missed by this, what I believe is a terrible decision and by USA Basketball.”\n    \n\n\n            It would also have been far from unprecedented for a rookie to make the team.\n    \n\n\n            Previously, four WNBA rookies - Rebecca Lobo in 1996, Diana Taurasi in 2004, Candace Parker in 2008 and Breanna Stewart in 2016 – have been selected for Team USA’s Olympic rosters, while Christian Laettner made the 1992 ‘Dream Team’ roster as an NBA rookie.\n    \n\n\n            “Often USA Basketball men’s and women’s will pick a collegiate … as an homage, as a bit of a tip of the hat to the college game and the growth of the game, which is in the mission in statement of USA Basketball, growing the game,” Brennan explains.\n    \n\n\n            With or without Clark, Team USA is the overwhelming favorite to win gold in Paris and continue its unbeaten Olympic record stretching back to 1992.\n    \n\n\n            Clark will just have to wait a little longer to join the squad.\n    \n\n© 2025 Cable News Network.

Sankar Muthusamy.\n\nA win will likely see Zii Jia play fellow Malaysian Soong Joo Ven in the second round.\n\nThank you for your report!\n\nCopyright © 1995-\n            \n\n Star Media Group Berhad [197101000523 (10894-D)]\n\nBest viewed on Chrome browsers.\n\n\n\nWe would love to keep you posted on the latest promotion.

In the second game, they should have taken the opportunity in front of them. They needed to be braver and put more pressure on their opponents.\n\n“Moving forward, I hope they stay consistent to become a world class pair.”\n\nWei Chong-Kai Wun will now take a break from tournaments and will compete next in the Japan Open in August.\n\nThank you for your report!\n\nCopyright © 1995-\n            \n\n Star Media Group Berhad [197101000523 (10894-D)]\n\nBest viewed on Chrome browsers.\n\n\n\nWe would love to keep you posted on the latest promotion.

She's now set for the final on Tuesday night.\n\n\"The enormity of what she's trying to achieve is very evident, but far out, my respect for her is sky-high, because after having two kids myself my mind boggles with the juggling she's been doing, the ability to believe in her body again after it changed so much and to also go, 'I still back myself to have the ability to put together a race where I'm competitive enough to possibly go to my fifth Olympics',\" says Rooney, who won Olympic gold at Athens 2004.\n\n\"I just think she's absolutely extraordinary. I hope it happens for her. I would love nothing more than to be able to call a race in Paris with Emily Seebohm as a mum.\"\n\nFrom left: Emily Seebohm, Leisel Jones, Libby Trickett and Jess Schipper celebrate winning gold in the 4x100m medley relay at Beijing 2008. Al Bello/Getty Images\n\nSeebohm and freestyle great Cate Campbell will become the first Australian swimmers to make five Olympic appearances if they are selected for the Paris Games, moving beyond breaststroke champion Leisel Jones.\n\nWatch Australia's Paris 2024 swimming trials on Nine and 9Now.\n\nSeebohm is vying to become the first mother to swim for Australia at an Olympic Games since Hayley Lewis at Sydney 2000.\n\nThe only other mother to have swum for Australia at an Olympic Games was Lisa Curry, who competed in Barcelona in 1992.\n\n\"From my own personal experiences, I can't comprehend it,\" Rooney says.\n\n\"I feel as a mum, and a new mum, there is so much in your world that led me to doubt myself and my ability to be a good mum and do the right thing for my baby.\n\nGiaan Rooney, pictured celebrating relay gold at Athens 2004, says she's glad she retired in 2006 because she avoided facing an exceptional 14-year-old called Emily Seebohm. Stuart Hannagan/Getty Images\n\n\"To also have an athlete mentality at the same time [is incredible] ... You are incredibly selfish as an elite athlete. It is all about you. What is right for you, what is best for you, how you get the best out of yourself at the next training session, rest, recovery — all of those things are such a big component in not only your physical performance, but your mental capacity to put together the right race on the right day.\n\n\"I am just in awe of Em.\"\n\nThroughout Seebohm's career she's battled endometriosis, a painful disease in which tissue similar to the lining of the uterus grows outside the uterus, and has also struggled with an eating disorder.\n\nShe's talked about her health battles publicly and inspired many female athletes by being so courageous, including rising star Lani Pallister.\n\nEmily Seebohm poses with the bronze medal she won in the 200m backstroke at the Tokyo Olympics in 2021. Clive Rose/Getty Images\n\n\"She's been very open about those struggles and in turn that's allowed a lot of other female athletes to also voice their struggles,\" Rooney says.\n\n\"Even when I was swimming it was very much about the fact that you didn't talk about anything you were struggling with in case that; A, you gave a competitor an edge; or B, knocked your own confidence. So a lot of things were swept under the carpet.\"\n\nMaking her Olympic debut at Beijing 2008, Seebohm was a member of the triumphant 4x100m medley relay team.\n\nAt London 2012 she formed part of the victorious 4x100m freestyle relay team, before winning her third gold medal as a member of the 4x100m medley relay team at Tokyo 2020.\n\nThe backstroke great has also won individual Olympic silver and bronze, as well as five world championship gold medals and seven Commonwealth Games gold medals.\n\nSeebohm became a mum in 2023. Delly Carr\n\n\"I retired in 2006 as a 23-year-old from backstroke events and everyone said, 'Oh, you can keep going, you've still got more left in the tank', and thank God I retired as a 23-year-old in 2006 because in 2007 a 14-year-old Emily Seebohm came along, and she would have kicked my butt,\" Rooney says.\n\n\"If and when she does decide to hang up the togs after this campaign, her legacy speaks for itself. She's been such an integral part of that swim team since 2007 ... Through the highs and the lows and the ups and the downs and the world championship moments, the Olympic moments, the Commonwealth Games moments ... She's been through it all and achieved it all, so her legacy very much speaks for itself, and whatever happens at trials, she should be so incredibly proud of herself.\"\n\n10 minutes ago\n\n21 minutes ago\n\n50 minutes ago\n\n© 2025 Nine Entertainment Co."

Christopher and I were at home, just the two of us in the house.\n\n“We just jumped around the kitchen. Christopher then ran outside and was running up and down.\n\n“Christopher was out on the street and everything. I’m sure the neighbours were laughing. It was brilliant!\n\n“We are all so proud of her, just bursting with pride.”\n\nCo Down speed machine Mageean had won bronze and silver medals at previous European Championships.\n\nBut the gutsy middle-distance runner bagged gold on Sunday despite being boxed in by British duo Bell and Reekie.\n\nWith just 90 metres left, fearless Ciara managed to find a gap down the home stretch to better her bronze and silver medals at previous European Championships.\n\nThe superstar runner hails from a well-known GAA family in the Down hurling stronghold of Portaferry.\n\nAlong with her siblings, she wore the club colours, while her father Christopher was part of the Down team that famously relegated reigning All-Ireland champions Kilkenny from Division 1 of the Allianz League in 1993.\n\nCiara’s mother Catherine was also a talented camogie player in her youth.\n\nAnd reflecting on her daughter’s European 1500m Final gold, Catherine says Ciara’s GAA roots lining out for St Patrick’s Portaferry gave her the physical edge she needed to muscle through and take the title on Sunday.\n\nCatherine told us: “The camogie definitely helped. That was her first love.\n\n“I could see when she spotted that gap, if you watch the replay, she sort of blows out and then takes a big intake of breath and just goes, I swear to God as if she was going for a goal. Straight on through and once the heels started to lift, there was nobody going to catch her. That was her, she was through.\n\n“It was as if she was going for goal, I could just see her with the hurl and the ball in her hand. That was the look on her face. There was going to be no holding her back. She was just waiting for the opening to get through.\n\n“There is a strong GAA background in the family. I did play a bit but my sister Edel was a far better camogie player than I ever was. Christopher played for Down and for Ulster, he certainly enjoyed hurling. I was a hurling widow for manys a day.”\n\nMageean has set her sights on further glory at the Paris Olympics in August after racing to European 1500m gold in Rome.\n\nCiara came home in 4.04.66 to make it a career full house of bronze, silver and gold medals for her at the championships.\n\nBut following the medal ceremony at the European Championships, determined Mageean is making an immediate return to training in the high altitude Swiss town of St Moritz.\n\nMum Catherine told us how Ciara’s homecoming celebrations have been put on ice until after the Olympics.\n\nShe said: “Ciara won’t be over here for a while yet. She will be heading straight back to St Moritz. Back up to altitude. She just can’t wait to get back into training. She is eager, she is wanting to make the best of it.\n\n“So Ciara will be going back to altitude, she is concentrating now. She has really been trying to stay at altitude for most of the time and trying to cut down on losing the benefit of that by not travelling unnecessarily.\n\n“After the Olympics, she will hit home. It will not be until everything is sort of over at the end of the summer.”\n\nWith homecoming plans on hold, the Mageean clan are finalising plans to travel to support their girl at the Paris Olympics.\n\nCatherine said: “We’re all heading to Paris. My son is in England so he is going by Eurostar. But the rest of us are flying en masse from Dublin, extended family as well. We’re looking forward to it. A bit nervous about the whole thing. It has taken a long time to plan. You were in the draw for spaces to do your tickets and then you had to wait for the flights to be released and then you had to wait for hotels to take your bookings. It seems to be a real protracted affair but now it is on the horizon.\n\n“The heats for the women’s 1500m start on August 6, then the semi final is August 8 and the final is August 10. We head over on August 3 until the 12th, so we have a little bit of space on either side. We will make a holiday of it and see a few of the sites as well. We just can’t wait to cheer Ciara on.”\n\nAs Mageean gears up for the Olympics, Padraig Mason, treasurer of St Patrick’s GAC, Portaferry, also spoke of the joy in Ciara’s hometown GAA club with her European gold medal success.\n\nPadraig told the Irish Sun: “We’re all delighted and very proud of her to be honest. It is great that she finally got the gold medal and it is great that she showed her camogie skills in pushing through the pack. We thought she was going to get boxed in at the last, but once she seen the gap she went for it, we are absolutely delighted for her.\n\n“Ciara always keeps in contact with us. Any time she is home, she is out, she actually goes out and does a bit of training in the club as well whenever she is here. She has never forgotten her roots. When she is on the news, she always likes to get Portaferry involved in it. We are so proud of her.”\n\n©News Group Newspapers Limited in England No. 679215 Registered office: 1 London Bridge Street, London, SE1 9GF. \"The Sun\", \"Sun\", \"Sun Online\" are registered trademarks or trade names of News Group Newspapers Limited.

The team had scored a brilliant, seven-touch goal against world champions Germany in the FIH Pro League on June 1. The South African though wasn’t beaming on Sunday as Harmanpreet Singh and Co squandered a 2-1 lead and lost to hosts Great Britain 3-2 in London.\n\nIt’s been that kind of a Pro League season for India. Sensational in patches, off-colour in blocks with nervy endings, giving away goals, and at times games. Five wins and losses each, three shootout wins and as many defeats sum up India’s show in the nine-team tournament that has largely become a practice ground for most teams as they prepare for the Olympics.\n\nStill, the elite event gives coaches a fair idea of where their teams stand against the world’s best. Wins against Germany, Argentina, Spain and Ireland give India hope for Paris but losses against the world’s best – Australia, Olympic champions Belgium and Great Britain – has given Fulton a lot to brood over.\n\n“Like all teams, India is going through the process of Olympic selection. That always slows down performance. I don’t think we have seen the very best India can be. They are probably playing at 80% of their capacity at the moment. As we get closer to the Olympics, some of the strengths like penalty corners (PC) and counterattacks will come into play a bit more,” Shane McLeod, who guided Belgium to gold at the 2018 World Cup and 2021 Tokyo Olympics, said from Antwerp.\n\nBarring the 1-7 debacle against Australia, consistency was key for India at Tokyo as they clinched an Olympic medal – bronze – after 41 years. That steadiness is absent at the moment. Besides, India’s performances in away games were below par compared to their show at home. The conditions in Paris will be similar to those in Antwerp and London where India played the last two legs of the league.\n\nIndia leaked goals, especially at crucial junctures, giving away 35 goals in 16 matches. During penalty corner (PC) defence, Amit Rohidas and Manpreet Singh gave it their all as first rushers, but opposition teams still found ways to get through the defence multiple times, especially in the dying moments of the match, an Achilles heel for India.\n\n“They have taken quite a few goals. But I don’t think it’ll happen at the Olympics. They will tighten up. Some of it was personnel driven while some of it was trying to put the team together. It is going to be a focus area for India,” added McLeod, who is now a consultant with Belgium.\n\n“PC defence can also be tightened up. They are still taking some goals. First running has improved quite a bit, so it is more difficult to get around the first runner. But they will be hoping to have a perfect battery for defending corners by the time the Games come about.”\n\nWith 12 goals, skipper and drag-flicker Harmanpreet was India’s top scorer for the third season on the trot. But the second PC battery comprising Jugraj Singh, Sanjay and Rohidas hasn’t fired much. That doesn’t seem to be a worry for the experts.\n\n“Belgium have Tom Boon and Loick Luypaert too, but it is always Alexander Hendrickx who is doing the trick. He is taking 90% of the flicks. You just have to adjust. That is what Olympic champions Belgium do at the top of the D,” former India coach Sjoerd Marijne said from Den Bosch, Netherlands.\n\n“Harmanpreet is a world-class drag-flicker. One of their keys to success would be to make sure India get enough PCs so that he is not under pressure each time he flicks. If they get 1-2 every game, it’s really hard but if they’re getting 5-6 you’re almost guaranteed he will get 1-2 of those, on a good day even three.”\n\nOne of the positive signs for India though was the brilliance of the forwards – Olympic bronze medallists Mandeep Singh, Sukhjeet Singh, Gurjant Singh, and newcomer Abhishek. Their individual skill resulted in many goals, lessening the impact of the lack of a strong second PC battery.\n\n“Mandeep up front is a world-class player. He is always dangerous, building up really nice connections with other players. Sukhjeet and Abhishek also showed real talent and ability. They are surely going to be players for the future if they don’t make the Olympic selection,\" added McLeod.\n\nWith less than 50 days left, Fulton has a lot of fine-tuning to do before India open their Games campaign against New Zealand at the Stade Yves-du-Manoir on July 27.\n\n\n\n"

        "expanded content": "Milan’s Olympic Village is under construction and located on the first of seven railyards slated for redevelopment.\n\n(Coima)\n\nThe lifecycle of an Olympic Village is a bit like that of the athletes who will call it home: years of preparation, a few weeks of fame, and then decades of a more ordinary existence once the games end.\n\nPart of this arc is likely to hold true for Milan’s Olympic Village, which is being built now in preparation for the Milan Cortina 2026 Winter Olympics and Paralympics. Nevertheless, developers and designers have high hopes for the Milan complex’s third act as a hyper-sustainable, 1,700-bed student housing project and anchor for a new city park.\n\nA happy post-Olympic future is not a sure thing. Since the first Olympic Village was built for the 1932 Summer Olympics in Los Angeles, many host cities have been unable to convert their athlete dormitories into successful permanent facilities. “A lot of them haven’t been successful in terms of being durable works of architecture that transcend their first use and become contributors to the place [where] they were built,” said Colin Koop, a New York–based design partner of Skidmore, Owings & Merrill (SOM), the lead architects for the Milan project.\n\nBut Koop thinks this village has the makings of a champion: “The site is an incredible [one]—most Olympic Villages don’t have the site we have,” he said.\n\nMilan’s Olympic Village, which is currently under construction, is located in the first of seven railyards slated for redevelopment in the city of 1.35 million people—parcels that will eventually add 247 acres (100 hectares) of green space and mixed-use development to Italy’s fashion and finance capital.\n\nThe 47-acre (19-hectare) former railyard (scalo) is located in the semi-industrial Porta Romana neighborhood.\n\nPorta Romana “is at the very extreme southern edge of Milan. If you walk 10 to 15 minutes south, you start to see farmland. It’s got a very, very sharp edge—there are no suburbs on the southern side of Milan,” Koop said.\n\nThe Porta Romana neighborhood was once outside the city wall. “Porta Romana just means Roman gate,” “and you used to have to pay a tax to bring anything [through] the gate …. People who wanted to avoid paying that tax would build their facility just outside the city wall, in the middle of farmland, so it has this agrarian-industrial legacy. The imprint of that [practice] you can still see—some of those older buildings are still around.”\n\nToday, however, the Porto Romana is nearer to the cutting edge of fashion than to the edge of town, the area near the gate having found a new life as a cultural quarter whose highlights include the Milan venue of the Prada Foundation, an old factory in the Largo Isarco complex that was reinvented by architect Rem Koolhaas as a contemporary art and cultural exhibition space.\n\nThe opening of the Prada Foundation space in 2015 helped spur residential growth in the neighborhood, according to Koop, with gentrification proceeding along the usual lines: first, “the young people come, then the young professionals come, and then the wealthier professionals come, and these waves of change start washing over the neighborhood,” he said.\n\nDevelopers hope that the redevelopment of the Scalo di Porta Romana, which is located across the street from the Prada Foundation, will further enliven a section of the city long separated from the center by the fenced-off railyard.\n\nA street-level view of some of the housing created by the project. \n\n(SOM/Coima)\n\n\n\nPlanning for the railyard’s redevelopment as the Parco Romana began in 2020, when the Gruppo FS Italiane (the Italian State Railway Group), opened a tender for the scalo.\n\nFondo Porta Romana, a development consortium formed by institutional investors COIMA SGR, Covivio, and Prado Holding, won the bid to develop the parcel in 2020, and master planning began in 2021. The master plan, which was executed by the OUTCOMIST team—which consists of Diller Scofidio + Renfro, and other design, engineering, and architecture firms—was completed in November 2022, when the consortium finally closed the deal with Gruppo FS, purchasing the parcel for €180 million ($193 million).\n\nIn addition to the roughly 318,000 square feet (29,570 sq m) of student accommodation, the development will eventually have another 602,000 square feet (56,000 sq m) of office, hotel, and retail space. Ultimately, the Parco Romana will encompass apartments, offices, social housing, and student accommodation, and entail the redevelopment of the 47-acre (19 ha) parcel as a pedestrian area, including more than 23.5 acres (9.5 ha) of green space, most of it located in a large central park.\n\nBut Koop and the SOM team were focused on the first stage of the railyard’s life, as a six-dormitory Olympic Village. For this first incarnation, the complex needed to be both fortress and a light-transit hub, Koop said.\n\nThen came the bigger design challenge, a vision for the buildings after the games end in March 2026: “How do you make something that works for that first phase but actually functions as [part] of the fabric of … Milan for a long time?” he said.\n\nThe team needed to build the complex and grounds in such a way that they would ultimately help “stitch two parts of the city back together.”\n\n“For us, the most interesting thing was how to be that suture, how to actually make this place porous and interconnected, and vibrant and welcoming to all sorts of people, not just the students [who] are living there,” Koop said.\n\nOne important choice was to restore two of the three old railyard buildings, which Koop said was not a difficult decision to make. “It was a no-brainer and beautiful. I was quite inspired by them and felt … they represented those eras, those layers of history on the site.\n\n“It was costly—we had to [devote] significant funds to restoring both of them—but I think the benefit … we have now is that the project doesn’t just go in as this enormous mega-construction. Now we have the benefit of the six new buildings getting placed next to two historic buildings, and hopefully that gives it much more connection to its context more quickly,” he said.\n\nFor the landscaping, Koop said he shared a vision for the park similar to that of the project’s landscape architect, Michel Desvigne. “My vision was not a kind of park, per se … it was a little bit of everything all intermingled in a single space, so you’ve got restaurants and cafés filling out right next to the basketball courts right next to the garden walks, which are adjacent to a large plaza where people can sell [at] a green market on the weekend,” Koop said. “It needed to have all those different pieces together.”\n\nOne way SOM tried to bring people and spaces together was by including large communal balconies that stretch between the six buildings, which Koop said is a feature he borrowed from Milanese apartment houses.\n\n“Milan is a courtyard city—[with] these beautiful pockets of open spaces that are mysteriously hidden away as you walk along the streets. And oftentimes, in the lower-income buildings, those courtyards will be lined with these communal terraces,” Koop said. “Sometimes, you would actually climb staircases and walk along these [terraces] to get to the doors of the various apartments—people would do their laundry on them, people would sit on them. This is definitely a homage to that tradition.”\n\nThe 13–20 foot (4–6 m) communal “balconies” that connect the six new buildings will have green [vegetation] walls growing over them, he said, but, at the same time, he hopes they will be kind of a public space that connects the students with other city residents, “so that there’s a real relationship between the balcony and the people below.”\n\nSustainability was another important feature in the design, one mandated in its financing, a €250 million ($268 million) sustainability-linked loan from the Intesa Sanpaolo bank.\n\nThe village is being built according to nearly zero-energy building requirements. All buildings will be LEED certified, with more than 30 percent of the energy generated via renewable solar systems, and a rainwater-collection system that is to reduce carbon dioxide emissions for heating and cooling by 40 percent.\n\nKoop noted two design choices that helped make the buildings much greener—first, the tilted roofs, which made the solar panels 15 percent more productive, and second, the use of a modular prefabricated building system for the buildings’ frames, which reduced their embodied carbon by 20 percent.\n\nIn addition to being greener, the modular system has also proved to be much faster than traditional building methods. “It’s essentially a kit of parts—they use cranes to erect everything …. It’s an incredibly fast process,” Koop said.\n\nAs a design approach, the modular system had no downsides. “There are constraints that come with any system [you choose],” Koop said, “but I don’t know if I think it’s any more constrained than working in a steel system or a concrete system. The real constraint is, honestly, the fact that it’s student housing, which has to be done with hyper-efficiency on a floor-plate basis.”\n\nYet despite the time pressure of completing the village ahead of the games, SOM has focused largely on a future in which the Porta Romana “is more residential, when there is more foot traffic, when it is going to be located next to a really large public park that’s at the heart of the future development,” Koop said. “It’s [designed less] for Day 1 than it is for Day 1,000 or 5,000.” \n\nThe 2024 ULI Europe Conference will be hosted in Milan in June.

However, Newgarden was not penalised for hitting Herta.\n\nStan Sport is the only place to watch the 2024 IndyCar Series.

You see me slowing down, he doesn't even attempt to slow down. Just dumps me.

It's disappointing because this is the third week in a row, whether it was self-inflicted or not, where I thought we should win and we didn't. \n\n\"The third week in a row where we've been so fast and we have relatively nothing to show for it. \n\n\"I'm not happy with sixth place with the car that we had today and the pace we had in the car. I don't know. I don't know what to say. Disappointing.\"\n\nLinus Lundqvist (middle), Colton Herta (left), and Marcus Armstrong (right) spin on lap one of the Grand Prix of Road America. Stan Sport\n\nCommentator Townsend Bell, who has 10 starts in the Indianapolis 500 to his name, said IndyCar officials may have reasoned Newgarden couldn't avoid the collision.\n\nReplay footage showed Newgarden come off the throttle a split second before hitting Herta, giving him little time to react.\n\nAnother commentator, James Hinchcliffe, said Newgarden didn't have a \"front-row seat\" to the chaos unfolding in front of him and could be forgiven for that.\n\n\"Newgarden gets out of the throttle, tries to hit the brakes. Diff (Leigh Diffey), you and I called it unavoidable contact,\" Bell explained.\n\n\"Herta is like 'I don't understand how that's not a penalty'  – well, I think IndyCar officials look at this and say there was an accident up front, everybody checked up, and Newgarden couldn't avoid the accident. \n\n\"I don't think Herta sees it the same way. Newgarden was accelerating at the exit pretty aggressively and at the last second dumped the throttle. I think that's what Colton is upset about.\"\n\nColton Herta finished sixth in the Grand Prix of Road America. Chris Owens via IndyCar\n\nAsked about the incident, Newgarden said he hadn't taken time to watch the replay to have a full understanding of the clash.\n\n\"I remember just everyone checking up on the exit of the corner,\" said Newgarden.\n\n\"I sort of centre-punched Colton. I hate that most likely affected his race. I'm sure he went spinning because of it.\n\n\"I don't know why everyone checked up on the exit. I didn't see that. I saw people going on the outside. \n\n\"I'm sure something was going on in front of him. It must have been. That's the only thing I can remember without seeing the actual replay.\"\n\nHerta has been a consistent threat this year but has little to show for it beyond two podiums at St Petersburg and Long Beach.\n\nThe 24-year-old has had a wretched run of late. At the Indianapolis 500, he qualified 13th and crashed out on lap 86.\n\nDespite only suffering minor cosmetic damage, Herta got out of his car and ended his hopes.\n\nOn the streets of Detroit, he finished 19th after he slid off the track trying to make a pass in damp conditions.\n\nHerta sits inside the top 10 and remains firmly in contention for the title but admits it's hard to stomach the lacklustre results with the speed he knows he has.\n\n\"I'd like to get wins instead of saying 'Oh these points might matter' and whatnot,\" Herta said.\n\n\"The last three weeks have just been terrible for me. I hope to turn it around. I hope to have some sort of luck. \n\n\"This car has been fast, this crew has been good on the stops, on the strategy, every single place we've gone so far. \n\n\"To not have a win and only have a handful of podiums is disappointing in my book.\"\n\nThe IndyCar Series takes a short break before returning on June 24 at Laguna Seca.\n\n10 minutes ago\n\n22 minutes ago\n\n50 minutes ago\n\n© 2025 Nine Entertainment Co."

And, on a wild night in Rome, the welcome sight of Dina Asher-Smith powering to a 100m gold medal again at these European Athletics Championships.\n\nBut Britain’s greatest sprinter was forced to recover from one of the worst starts of her career, which left her several metres down on her rivals. But she refused to panic, and showed considerable grit as well as class to come through in 10.99 sec.\n\nThat put her just 0.03 clear of Poland’s Ewa Swoboda, who claimed silver, with Italy’s Zaynab Dosso taking bronze. No wonder Asher-Smith whispered the words “Fuck me” as she crossed the line and gave a look that suggested she couldn’t quite believe she had pulled off this Italian job.\n\nIncredibly, this was also the 28-year-old’s first major title since winning 200m at the world championships in 2019 – due to the pandemic, multiple injuries, including a hamstring tear six weeks before the Tokyo Olympics, and multiple other bad beats.\n\nBut here, at last, there was a sense of redemption, and of renewed hope. “I didn’t panic in my running,” she said . “But my head was a different story.\n\nWe have worked really hard on my technique, my mechanics, my top end speed,” she added. “And I was very grateful for that today. That’s not normally my style of race.”\n\nIt was also vindication for Asher-Smith’s decision last autumn to take the radical step of moving from Bromley in Kent to Austin, Texas. In the US she works under a new coach, Edrick “Flo” Floréal, a new training group, including 100m star Julien Alfred, and has also taken up golf and pottery.\n\nNow she is trying to sculpt a better life on the track too – although she admits it is still a work in progress. “I’m in a great place, but when you’ve got a few new things to get your head round sometimes it does take a little bit of time,” she admitted. “Overall I’m really happy that I’m six to eight months into a new setup and I’m here putting together performances like this back to back.”\n\nBut while Asher-Smith’s victory provided the biggest headline, this was a day when Britain’s women also won four other medals in the 1500m, half marathon, and 3,000m steeplechase.\n\nPerhaps the most heartwarming story came in the women’s 1500m as Georgia Bell, who quit the sport after going to university before taking it up again during the pandemic thanks to parkrun, won a brave silver medal.\n\nBell, who is taking a sabbatical from her job working in AI and cyber-security, has made huge strides since starting work with Trevor Painter, who coaches Olympic and world 800m silver medallist Keely Hodgkinson, two years ago.\n\nBut this was her finest moment yet as she held her nerve in a slowly run race to come second behind Ireland’s Ciara Mageean, who took gold in 4:04.66. France’s Agathe Guillemot took bronze, but the Briton’s highly fancied other finalists, Jemma Reekie and Katie Snowden could only finish fifth and ninth.\n\nSign up to The Recap\n\nThe best of our sports journalism from the past seven days and a heads-up on the weekend’s action\n\nafter newsletter promotion\n\n“I’m glad I came back to the sport,” said Bell. “I don’t know what I’d be doing right now at home with the Sunday scaries ahead of work tomorrow, but instead I’m here. I’m on a sabbatical over the summer, so I have had a little break which is really nice, just to have time to not have to fit in training before and after work.”\n\nNow she is focusing on trying to make Team GB’s squad for the Olympics for which she is surely a shoo-in now. “Work were really fantastic,” she said. “I asked after the World Indoors for a sabbatical.\n\n“Steve Cram did me a solid because on the BBC he said something like: ‘Georgia must know if she gives running a good go she has got a good shot,’ and everyone in my work was tuned in. So they were like: ‘Ah, maybe she is kind of good, and maybe we should support her over the summer’.”\n\nEarlier in the day, Britain won a first gold medal of these championships in the half marathon team event through Calli Hauger-Thackery, Abbie Donnelly, Clara Evans and Lauren McNeil. Hauger-Thackery also took individual bronze behind Norway’s Karoline Bjerkeli Grøvdal.\n\nThere was another British medal in the women’s 3000m steeplechase as Lizzy Bird ran a controlled race to take bronze in 9:18.39.\n\nMeanwhile there was a first gold medal for Ukraine at these European championships as the high jump world champion Yaroslava Mahuchikh won with a clearance of 2:01m."

Get features like\n\nWhether one would like to admit it or not, Caitlin Clark has admirably consolidated her position as the most popular women's basketball player in the US. Yet, the standout WNBA rookie sensation has been left out of the 2024 US Olympic roster, and the controversial decision is on everyone's mind.\n\nAccording to DailyMirror.co.uk, the WNBA's Chicago Sky vs Indiana Fever game, featuring Chennedy Carter's cheap shot on Clark, averaged 1.53 million viewers, resulting in a 346% spike in the audience compared to the professional league's 2023 regular season average on ESPN. Mail Sport also conveyed the stats reported in an NBA press release, confirming the viewership for this game, which marked Clark's first matchup against her longtime college rival Angel Reese, peaked at 2.19 million on ESPN. Per SportsMediaWatch.com's stats, the Saturday Fever-Sky game is now also reportedly marked the fourth-highest WNBA audience in the past 22 years. \n\nAgreeably, the staggering jump in audience numbers was attributed to the classic fumes of rivalry between the rookie stars and not just Clark's presence. Yet, Fever #22's fame rose new heights as each of these top 4 games have featured Clark and her team - her May 12 debut on ESPN2 (Fever vs Sun - 2.12M), May 18 Fever vs Liberty on ABC (1.71M) and May 20 Fever vs Connecticut on ESPN (1.56M).\n\nAlso read | Who is Puja Tomar, 1st Indian MMA fighter to win at UFC?\n\nDespite the ever-rising boost to the WNBA viewership ushered in by Clark's arrival (not to erase the credit due to all other active players), the USA Basketball squad has not only snubbed Clark, but also dropped the golden opportunity to rake in all the attention and valuable ratings during the Olympic season. Ironically, the same uproarious attention tied to Clark's popularity has seemingly led to her exclusion from the upcoming Paris games. Here's why.\n\nIn a recently published USA Today Sports report, two long-time US Basketball veterans, whose anonymity was maintained throughout the address, suggested all the emotional baggage that tags along with Clark had a lot to do with the decision making. Her Team USA snub allegedly played out while taking heed of the fervid reactions that would have followed had Clark been on the team and been offered a limited playing time considering the weight of the stacked roster of players.\n\nOne can't help but hypothetically envision how Clark's presence at the Olympics would have considerably ignited interest and headlines among the world's media representatives. Moreover, the Olympic roster's revelation couldn't have dropped at a worse time, especially when the 22-year-old secured a WNBA rookie record-tying seven 3's, scoring 30 points against Washington Mystics. The venue accounted for the largest WNBA crowd in 17 years, with 20,333 in attendance, among whom, hundreds honoured Clark's popularity by sporting her No. 22 jerseys in the crowd.\n\nAlso read | Viral: Glen Powell's ‘crazy’ cannibal story throws the Internet off balance, unearths urban legend from early 2000s\n\nMaking matters worse, just as the news of Team USA missing out on making the most of Clark's hot ticket as an indisputable buzz magnet hit the Internet, the team coach's “eight-word” message about Fever's #22 also turned heads.\n\nTeam USA coach Cheryl Reeve, who's also the head coach of the WNBA's Minnesota Lynx, reportedly pointed out that she shares no consequential history with Clark. USA TODAY Sports reporter Nancy Armour wrote on X/Twitter, “When I asked Cheryl Reeve at USOPC Summit about Clark, she said, ‘I’ve never been in the trenches with her.’ Not even at a USA Basketball camp. Asking a coach to integrate someone she has no history with, at tournament with highest stakes, is a lot. A lot a lot.\"\n\nHowever, that's not all Reeve has said about the 2024 draft's No. 1 overall pick. Previously, Reeve took flak upon hitting back at all the attention on Clark as she pushed for the social media hashtag “#theWismorethanoneplayer” while driving the spotlight back on the rest of the league.\n\nIn May, she wrote on her X feed, “ALSO in action tonight - @minnesotalynx vs @chicagosky 7pm CST. Though fans won't be able to watch, #Lynx fans can go to the Lynx app to follow along via play by play. Or if you are in market, come to the game...as we start the season off right ✅#12teams #theWismorethanoneplayer.\" Her words aren't lost on basketball loyalists, who have again redirected the focus to her previous remarks, alluding to the alleged politics possibly at play here.\n\nAs Team USA pledged its allegiance to a veteran cause, it typically did so to drive away from the chatter and focus on basketball. Ironically though, the officials have succeeded in achieving the exact opposite as severe and discontent reviews for the 12-person Olympic roster omitting Clark continue to pour in.\n\nAs for Clark's take on the snub, she expressed “no diappointment,” according to the media coverage by The Athletic. \"I think it just gives you something to work for. That’s a dream. Hopefully one day I can be there. I think it’s just a little more motivation. You remember that.”\n\nCaitlin Clark's loyal fanbase is already rooting for her to be a leading force on the potential 2028 Olympics roster, when Los Angeles will be hosting the international summer multi-sports event.\n\n\n\n"

McLaughlin-Levrone also ran 48.74 last July.\n\nAfterward, she said she hoped to break the American record.\n\n“Just wanted to get out there, get a race under me,” she told Lewis Johnson on NBC Sports. “The wind was a little interesting on the back stretch, but I’m happy with the time.”\n\nTRACK AND FIELD: Full Results\n\nThough she is the world’s fastest woman in this Olympic cycle in the 400m, McLaughlin-Levrone has repeated over the last month that she plans to race strictly the 400m hurdles at the Olympic Trials, which are June 21-30 in Eugene, Oregon. \n\nMcLaughlin-Levrone is the reigning Olympic gold medalist and world record holder in the 400m hurdles and has never raced the flat 400m at a global championship. \n\nThis season, she has also raced the 100m hurdles and 200m to prep for her primary event.\n\n“Working on coming home,” she said of Sunday’s race. “Going to need it for those hurdles.”\n\nAlso Sunday, three-time world champion Noah Lyles won the men’s 200m in 19.77 into a 1.6 meter/second headwind on the home stretch. The race started after a 10-minute delay due to a starting blocks issue.\n\nFellow American Kenny Bednarek remains fastest in the world this year with a 19.67 from May 10.\n\n“I think I said yesterday I wanted the world lead (fastest time in the world in 2024),” Lyles said. “I guess the wind had disagreement there.”\n\nFavour Ofili of Nigeria won the women’s 100m in 11.18 into a 2.1 m/s headwind. Jamaica’s Elaine Thompson-Herah, the two-time reigning Olympic gold medalist, was last in 11.48.\n\nThompson-Herah limped afterward as she decelerated, then took off her right shoe and was carried away from the track by two men. \n\n“I felt something uncomfortable as I began to push I still tried to go but it got worse,” was posted on her social media.\n\nThe Jamaican Olympic Trials are June 27-30. \n\nUnlike the U.S. trials, Jamaica has allowed medical exemptions onto the Olympic team. In 2016, Usain Bolt withdrew during the trials with a hamstring tear and was placed on the Olympic team in the 100m and 200m.\n\nIn the men’s 100m, 2022 World champion Fred Kerley was disqualified after a false start while also having a problem with his starting blocks. Udodi Onwuzurike of Nigeria later won in 10.24.\n\nBahamian Devynne Charlton won the 100m hurdles in 12.56 seconds, beating a field that included world record holder Tobi Amusan of Nigeria (third, 12.66) and world champion Danielle Williams of Jamaica (fourth, 12.71).\n\nFour-time Olympian Kara Winger won the javelin with a 63.22-meter throw in her first competition since retiring after the 2022 season. \n\nThe automatic Olympic qualifying standard in the event is 64 meters, which must be recorded by the end of Olympic Trials.

It's a dream, hopefully one day I can be there. I think it's just a little bit more motivation. You remember that and hopefully when four years comes back around, I can be there.'\n\nClark also revealed that she was already aware she hadn't been picked before the news broke. \n\n'They called me and let me know before everything came out, which was really respectful of them and I appreciated that,' Clark continued.\n\n'They did the same for every girl that made the team or every girl that didn't make the team. There's a lot of players in the Olympic pool, so it wasn't like I was the only one they had to call. They had to make quite a few calls.'\n\nThe Indiana Fever rookie will reportedly miss out on Cheryl Reeve's 12-player squad\n\n'I don't know who's making the decision, Women's Olympic Committee or whatever it is. I don't care if you don't think Caitlin Clark talent-wise belongs on this team, even though she does put up 37 at 13 - the most points in the history of the league for a rookie.\n\n'None of it matters. These women - and I love women, I'm a pro-women guy - they complain, they cry about equal rights, equal wages, blah blah blah... Hey dummies, for the first time in the history of basketball, you have arguably the player who is the most popular player in the world.\n\n'You can argue that Caitlin Clark is the most popular, most puts-a**es-in-the-seats, single basketball player in the world. You can argue that. And you leave her off the Olympics team?\n\n'It's not only a showcase for her, it's for the sport and the other WNBA players that are on this team. How dumb, how braindead, how idiotic do the people running this thing have to be? It's one thing after another with her.'\n\nDave Portnoy (left) is furious with Caitlin Clark (right) not expected to go to the Olympics\n\nJason Whitlock also reacted furiously, blaming 'BLM-LGBTQIA+Silent P Alphabet Mafia bigots' in a string of angry social media posts.\n\nAt first, Whitlock said he was pleased Clark would not compete in the upcoming Games, writing: 'Am I the only one glad they left Caitlin Clark off the Olympic team? Now I don't have to watch a bunch of angry, entitled feminists who hate America play hoops.'\n\nBut the target of Whitlock's anger soon moved away from patriotism when he wrote: 'They/Thems Hate Cait. End of story.'\n\nHe continued in a separate post: 'Women's basketball decision-makers are not dumb. They've been bullied by the BLM-LGBTQIA+Silent P Alphabet Mafia bigots. \n\n'Same cowardice that built George Floyd statues, turned Juneteenth into a federal holiday, codified same-sex marriage, allows 'kid-friendly' drag shows, let 'Lia Thomas' swim... They keep making offers we don't refuse.\n\n'The Mafia hates Cait. She refuses to publicly worship the Yas Queens and doesn't scissor, so she sleeps with the fishes.'\n\nWhile at Iowa, Clark became the all-time leading scorer in NCAA Division I basketball. She also rose to become among the biggest names in American sports.\n\nJason Whitlock blamed 'BLM-LGBTQIA+ alphabet mafia' for Clark's surprise omission\n\nShe went on to be selected by the Fever with the No. 1 overall pick in April's draft and has averaged 16.8 points on 37.3 percent shooting, 6.3 assists and 5.3 rebounds per game in 12 starts. \n\nShe scored a career-high 30 points on 7-of-13 three-point shooting in the Fever's 85-83 win over the Washington Mystics on Friday night. \n\nHowever, Reeve has reportedly favored experience in her roster selection as Team USA looks to defend their Gold in Paris. \n\nWilson, Stewart, Diana Taurasi, Brittney Griner, Alyssa Thomas, Napheesa Collier, Jewell Loyd, Kelsey Plum, Jackie Young, Sabrina Ionescu, Chelsea Gray and Kahleah Copper are expected to be named to the squad, according to The Athletic. \n\nThe WNBA season will be taking a hiatus from July 21 to August 14 for the games with the Americans opening the tournament in Group C against Germany, Japan and Belgium. \n\nThe USA will kickstart its quest for another medal on July 29 against the Japanese.\n\nTeam USA is eyeing its eighth consecutive Olympic basketball gold medal - and 10th overall - in Paris. \n\n\n\t    Share what you think\n          \n\nThe comments below have not been moderated.\n\n\n      The views expressed in the contents above are those of our users and do not necessarily reflect the views of MailOnline.\n    \n\nWe are no longer accepting comments on this article.\n\nPublished by Associated Newspapers Ltd\n\nPart of the Daily Mail, The Mail on Sunday & Metro Media Group"

Thinaah seem to have rediscovered their mojo right in the nick of time.\n\nThe Paris Olympic Games-bound Pearly-Thinaah have been struggling for consistency this year but turned in a much improved performance in the Indonesian Open.\n\nThe world No. 13 gave China’s world No. 1 and next month’s Paris Olympics gold medal favourites Chen Qingchen-Jia Yifan a scare before going down 20-22, 18-21 in the last eight in Jakarta on Friday.\n\nA day earlier, Pearly-Thinaah toppled home favourites and world No. 9 Apriyani Rahayu-Siti Fadia Ramadhanti 21-18, 21-19.\n\nIt was only the former’s second win this year over a pair in the world’s top 10 after they stunned Qingchen-Yifan in the second round of the All-England in March.\n\nAlthough Pearly-Thinaah could not repeat the feat in Jakarta, their overall showing has given them some much needed confidence ahead of the badminton competition in the Olympics from July 27-Aug 5.\n\nBefore the tournament, the pair’s best performance arguably came in the All-England where they also made it into the quarter-finals.\n\nPearly-Thinaah did reach the last four of the Malaysian Masters last month but all the top pairs in the world were absent from the home event.\n\nOn their overall performance in Indonesia, Pearly said: “Although we lost in the quarter-finals, I’m happy that Thinaah and I kept supporting each other and we managed to bring out our game play and regain our rhythm.\n\n“We could execute the strategy that we planned before the match but we just lost out during the crucial stages of the match.\n\n“Our opponents were more experienced and intelligent in winning the crucial points and we need to learn from them.\n\n“I can’t say that we are satisfied with our performance but this is a boost for us and it has really fired us up,” added Pearly.\n\nPearly-Thinaah will now fully turn their attentions to their preparations for the Olympics.\n\nThe pair, who will be making their debuts in the showpiece event, are keen to keep improving on several aspects in the time they have in order to give a solid showing.\n\n“Definitely, we need to still improve on our speed and endurance before the Olympics,” said Thinaah.\n\n“Most importantly, our communication also needs to be good and we need to keep supporting each other. We need to be more confident and believe in ourselves.”\n\n \n\nThank you for your report!\n\nCopyright © 1995-\n            \n\n Star Media Group Berhad [197101000523 (10894-D)]\n\nBest viewed on Chrome browsers.\n\n\n\nWe would love to keep you posted on the latest promotion.

Photo by Sam Barnes/Sportsfile\n\nAt this level one mistake is fatal, and Sarah Lavin got an unwelcome reminder of that at the European Championships in Rome on Saturday night, the 30-year-old Limerick athlete clattering the second barrier with her lead leg, ending her medal hopes in the 100m hurdles final.\n\nWith that, her chance was gone, Lavin running on and doing her best but having to settle for seventh place in 12.94. That left her trailing far behind French champion Cyrena Samba-Mayela, who powered to victory in a championship record of 12.31.\n\nSamba-Mayela, who is coached by Dubliner John Coghlan, will now be a leading hope for a home gold at the Paris Olympics.\n\nLavin was fifth in the European final two years ago and fifth at the World Indoor final in Glasgow earlier this year, and while she does have an international medal – a bronze at last year’s European Games – this championship carried far more significance. It was a huge chance, and one she missed.\n\n“I got out well to the first hurdle, smashed the second and lost all momentum – the race was gone,” said Lavin.\n\n“I’m so much better than that and I didn’t get to put it out. But if losing didn’t hurt, winning wouldn’t matter. That was a bad run.”\n\n\n\nEarlier in the night, she had swept to victory in her semi-final in 12.73, equalling her season’s best, but in truth, with 12.42 winning bronze, it would have taken something seismic for Lavin to reach the podium and keep the good times rolling for the Irish in Rome.\n\nBut still, with eight weeks to go until she lines up at the Paris Olympics, it was proof she’s in a very good spot – better than she’s ever been at this point of the season. Her chances of making a final on the biggest stage of all remain alive and well.\n\nElsewhere, Brian Fay produced a flying last lap in the 5000m final to finish 14th in 13:29.48, though he was much too far back before he discovered that extra gear. The race was won by Norway’s Jakob Ingebrigtsen in facile fashion in 13:20.11, and he will be back in action in the 1500m in the days ahead.\n\nIsrael Olatunde bowed out of the men’s 100m after finishing sixth in his semi-final in 10.40, well shy of what he needed to advance. Earlier in the day, Chris O’Donnell made an impressive turnaround after the mixed relay gold medal on Friday night – despite having had just one hour of sleep – to advance from his 400m heat, clocking a season’s best of 45.69 to finish fourth advance to Sunday night’s semi-final, where he will face a much stiffer assignment.\n\n“After last night, such a high, I didn’t really know what to expect and to get a big season’s best shows I brought the spirit of last night into this morning,” said the Sligo native.\n\n“That was what was going through my mind. The history we created last night, the buzz. We had to enjoy the moment because we are not European champions every day of the week but at the same time I had to kind of park it and look at his morning. I got barely any sleep but I was still riding that wave and it hasn’t crashed yet.”\n\n\n\n\n\nItaly’s Marcell Jacobs, the reigning Olympic champion, thrilled the home crowd by delivering gold in the men’s 100m final, clocking 10.02 to beat his teammate Chituru Ali (10.05).\n\nIn the men’s 20km race walk, Oisin Lane came home 23rd in 1:25:02, a race won by Sweden’s Perseus Karlstrom, who is coached by Ireland’s former world 50km champion Rob Heffernan. Karlstrom clocked 1:19:13.\n\n “It was a good experience,” said Lane. “I didn’t really have a good season of training, in February I got a chest infection which stayed with me for two to three months. I didn’t really have the mileage coming in, I knew I didn’t have the fitness going in but I set off and PB pace and said I’d see how it goes.\n\n\"I kept that for 8K and then died off a bit, but I was happy I kept on. The conditions worked in my favour, I came through and picked off a few people in the end.”\n\nLane hopes to team up with Kate Veale for a mixed marathon relay where they will chase Olympic qualification, with Veale’s recent attempt derailed due to an injury early in the race to teammate Brendan Boyce.\n\nEuropean Athletics Championships\n\n\n\n                Live, RTÉ Two, BBC Red Button Irish in action, Sunday (all times Irish)\n            \n\n\n\n8.00am: Hiko Tonosa, men’s half marathon\n\n\n8.30am: Shona Heaslip, women’s half marathon\n\n\n8.30am: Emily Haggard Kearney, women’s half marathon\n\n\n9.05am: Nicola Tuthill, women’s hammer qualification\n\n\n10.50am: Mark Smyth, men’s 200m heats\n\n\n11:40am: Kelly McGrory, women’s 400m hurdles heats\n\n\n12.20pm: Thomas Barr, men’s 400m hurdles heats\n\n\n7.05pm: Rhasidat Adeleke, Sharlene Mawdsley, Sophie Becker, women’s 400m semi-finals\n\n\n7.38pm: Chris O’Donnell, men’s 400m semi-finals\n\n\n8.35pm: *Mark Smyth, men’s 200m semi-finals\n\n\n9.40pm: Ciara Mageean, Sarah Healy, women’s 1500m final.\n\nFrom as little as €1 a week with our digital introductory offer.\n\nAlready a subscriber?

I don't care if you don't think Caitlin Clark talent-wise belongs on this team, even though she does put up 37 at 13 - the most points in the history of the league for a rookie.\n\n'None of it matters. These women - and I love women, I'm a pro-women guy - they complain, they cry about equal rights, equal wages, blah blah blah... Hey dummies, for the first time in the history of basketball, you have arguably the player who is the most popular player in the world.\n\n'You can argue that Caitlin Clark is the most popular, most puts-a**es-in-the-seats, single basketball player in the world. You can argue that. And you leave her off the Olympics team?\n\n'It's not only a showcase for her, it's for the sport and the other WNBA players that are on this team. How dumb, how braindead, how idiotic do the people running this thing have to be? It's one thing after another with her.'\n\nPortnoy then appeared to take aim at WNBA chiefs by saying: 'The business part of my brain is like, these people - and maybe it's a guy, whoever it is - I don't ever want to hear you complain about flying commercial, or not getting salaries, or this and that... you're too dumb! You're too dumb!\n\n'You have a cash cow. The Olympic women's basketball could be the No. 1 thing people watch with Caitlin Clark. \n\n'As it is, I would rather watch grass grow. I'd rather watch paint dry. I'd rather watch dirt be moved around, because Caitlin Clark's not on the team.\n\nWNBA rookie Clark will reportedly miss out on an Olympic place with Team USA this summer\n\nPortnoy has accused 'dumb women' of making the decision to leave the 22-year-old out\n\n'You people, whoever did this, take your brain, put it in a museum and study it for how dumb you are.' \n\nClark was one of 14 players called up to a training camp with Team USA in April but was unable attend as it came in the midst of Iowa's run to the NCAA championship game. \n\nWhile at Iowa, she became the all-time leading scorer in NCAA Division I basketball. She also rose to become among the biggest names in American sports.\n\nClark went on to be selected by the Fever with the No. 1 overall pick in April's draft and has averaged 16.8 points on 37.3 percent shooting, 6.3 assists and 5.3 rebounds per game in 12 starts. \n\nShe scored a career-high 30 points on 7-of-13 three-point shooting in the Fever's 85-83 win over the Washington Mystics on Friday night. \n\nHowever, head coach Cheryl Reeve has reportedly favored experience in her roster selection as Team USA looks to defend their Gold in Paris. \n\n\n\t    Share what you think\n          \n\nThe comments below have not been moderated.\n\n\n      The views expressed in the contents above are those of our users and do not necessarily reflect the views of MailOnline.\n    \n\nWe are no longer accepting comments on this article.\n\nPublished by Associated Newspapers Ltd\n\nPart of the Daily Mail, The Mail on Sunday & Metro Media Group"

Each week, all conversations around the rookie sensation and her team, Indiana Fever, seem to stop short at the turbulent outlook of the game, supposedly “hammering” the draft's No. 1 overall pick.\n\nConnecticut women's basketball head coach Geno Auriemma also joined the discussion, with nearly every industry veteran and expert weighing in on the situation around #22 and her star status in the big leagues. The national championship-winning coach's appearance on the Dan Patrick Show on Wednesday gained quite the buzzworthy traction once he got down to dissecting how Clark was possibly “set up for failure” on the professional front.\n\nLaunching snide remarks at “the delusional fanbase” surrounding the 22-year-old stat at Iowa, Auriemma didn't mince words while suggesting how disrespectful the new addition to the vast fandom of the WNBA has been to the other players on the roster.\n\nAlso read | Kate Middleton pens down emotional letter amid cancer battle: ‘I am very sorry that…’\n\nAuriemma addressed how Clark's overwhelming star status and her old followers have worked as a double-edged sword, equally piercing her and women's sports' collective stand. The 11-time national championship-winning coach said, “These people are so disrespectful and so unknowledgeable and so stupid, that it gives women's basketball a bad name.”\n\nEqually discerning the lethal impact on Clark, he added, “The kid was set up for failure right from the beginning.”\n\nSignalling that there was a “huge target” on Caitlin's back, Auriemma foregrounded the harsh landscape the 2024 rookie class of players had been exposed to. The basketball coach spotlighted how the onus of social media presence and pressures had unexpectedly burdened the new additions to the roster, with all sides of the conversation expecting nothing less than perfection from them.\n\nAlluding to Los Angeles Sparks star Cameron Brink's take on the “exhausting” WNBA rookies vs veterans narrative, Auriemma chimed in: “I thought Cameron Brink said something really smart… they're expecting this rookie class to be perfect. This rookie class isn't even one of the best rookie classes in the last ten years, but they've been put out to be that because the way social media is today.”\n\nAlso read | Howard University announces revocation of Sean 'Diddy' Combs' honorary degree following ‘disturbing’ CCTV footage\n\nHe'd previously remarked that Clark had a long journey ahead of her. Although Auriemma pointed out that she is not yet “built for the physicality of this league,” being on a better team and having more experience will add to her evolution as a player.\n\nThe Indiana Fever vs Washington Mystics Friday match again rendered the latter winless. Clark's team took a three-point lead with the final buzzer clocking in 85-83 on the scoreboard. Fever now has a 3-9 win-loss ratio.\n\nIn other news, bubbling media speculations surrounding the 2024 Team USA roster suggest Clark will likely be omitted from the team as Coach Cheryl Reeve is heavily leaning towards veteran players' inclusion. This would aid the WNBA rookie in finding more breathing room as she tackles all these initiating hits and bruises on the court.\n\nAccording to The Athletic, the 12-player Team USA squad is expected to bring back the defending champs, A'ja Wilson, Breanna Stewart, Brittney Griner, Alyssa Thomas, Diana Taurasi, Jewell Loyd, Jackie Young, Napheesa Collier, Sabrina Ionescu, Kelsey Plum, Kahleah Copper and Chelsea Gray for the Summer Olympics Paris round-trip.\n\n\n\n"

Afterwards the 21-year-old from Sheffield revealed how a WhatsApp message to the nine-time Olympic champion Carl Lewis asking him: “Can you fix me?” had changed his life.\n\n“I gave it everything, it’s what I’ve been working for the whole year,” said Hinchliffe after a late burst gave him victory in Eugene, Oregon, in a time that makes him the sixth-quickest Briton ever.\n\nBut, as he acknowledged, it has been some journey given that until the age of 16 he wanted to be a professional golfer and that, when he went to the University of Lancaster to study management and IT at 18, he spent more time partying than running as there was no track nearby. “I would get on a bus twice a week, 30 minutes away, to train,” he said. “I didn’t have any support, I was just a regular student.”\n\nWinning the 2022 English championships earned him a sports scholarship at the University of Washington, where he continued to improve. But his great leap forward came last August after he managed to find the phone number of Lewis, the 1984 and 1988 Olympic 100m champion, among other titles, and a coach at the University of Houston.\n\n“I had a couple of problems with my hamstring and my back,” said Hinchliffe. “And I didn’t have much guidance. He was like: ‘Let’s talk.’ We had a long phone call and he saw a lot of potential in me.”\n\nThat phone call led to Hinchliffe, who also ran a wind assisted 9.84sec last month, moving to Houston to study – and now to shatter the 10-second barrier. “It’s always been there. It’s finding the right place to do it, the right conditions and the right stadium,” he said.\n\nHe is now set to compete at the UK championships in Manchester at the end of this month, which act as the British trials for this summer’s Paris Olympics. “I’ve got to forget about this, because the main job is to get to the Olympics,” he says.\n\nSign up to The Recap\n\nThe best of our sports journalism from the past seven days and a heads-up on the weekend’s action\n\nafter newsletter promotion\n\nLewis, for one, has every confidence he will make it. “He’s going to be a great,” he says of Hinchliffe. “He’s going to be in the Olympics this year, I know he will make that team.”\n\nThis is the archive of The Observer up until 21/04/2025.

My love for this sport is strong and the desire to compete at the highest level is what keeps me going,” he said in a statement on social media after his operation.\n\nWith Wimbledon starting on July 1, a three-week timeline to regain full fitness for the grass-court Grand Slam would seem a risky move by the Serbian.\n\nMany believe the 37-year-old – who will drop to either No 2 or No 3 in the ATP Rankings after the French Open – will shift his focus to the 2024 Paris Games, which gets underway on July 27 at Roland Garros.\n\nWith the tournament taking place on clay, players will be eager to get a warm-up tournament on the surface ahead of the Olympics and Djokovic will reportedly enter the Hamburg Open.\n\nThe ATP 500 event will run from July 15-21 and Djokovic will likely be one of several high-profile players to enter the main draw as Alexander Zverev and Holger Rune have already confirmed their participation.\n\nBut former world No 1 Andy Roddick has warned that the 37-year-old Djokovic needs to carefully consider his comeback plans as he could cause further damage by returning too early.\n\nThe US Open starts just three weeks after the Olympics.\n\n“A torn meniscus in your knee is not a massive thing when you are 24, 25, 26, but the timing of this sucks. It’s the shortest time of the year for a turnaround,” Roddick told the Served With Andy Roddick podcast.\n\n“I’d say grass is his best surface right now and the worst surface for the guys he’s going against.\n\n“If he pulls out in two weeks, that’s bad. That also puts the US Open in jeopardy and he could just put a wrap on this season and have one final push next year. Let’s get healthy for next year.\n\n“The classy thing to do is if you know there is no chance of playing, you haven’t hit a tennis ball or do any fitness, the best thing he could do for the field is to pull out before the (Wimbledon) draw is made.”\n\n\n                Francisco Cerundolo suffered a shock opening round loss that could be significant.             \n\n\n                Fritz is guaranteed to slip down the ATP Rankings after a shock French Open exit.            \n\n\n                Chris Evert has given a brutal assessment of Novak Djokovic's French Open chances.            \n\n\n                Novak Djokovic: \"I put that pressure on myself, so this is definitely a relief.\"            \n\n© Planet Sport Limited 2025 • All Rights Reserved"

Analisi e risultati aggiornati minuto per minuto \n\nJune 07th, 2024  Australia, International, News, Previews & Recaps\n\nWith the 2024 Australian Olympic Trials on the horizon, we’re looking at the different dynamics about to unfold at the Brisbane Aquatic Centre beginning on June 10th.\n\nTo qualify for the Olympic Games, swimmers must be under the qualifying standard set by Swimming Australia and place inside the top two of their event at the Trials (outside of the 100 and 200 free, where up to the top six can be named). The qualifying times put in place by Swimming Australia are faster than the Olympic qualifying times published by World Aquatics.\n\nRather than previewing the meet by event, we’ve opted to focus more on the storylines for the Australian Trials, with the following articles to come:\n\nIn this article, we’re taking a look at some of the races that are shaping up to be cutthroat battles, as the top spots will be highly contested based on the pedigree and recent performances of the top-ranked swimmers.\n\nWhile it is never guaranteed who will slide into the Olympic spots, as a lower seed can always move up the rankings, below are a few of the races where the top couple of entrants are all bunched up, especially those closest to snagging the second spot.\n\nThe Olympic spots in the men’s 100 breast will be a tight race, as the top three seeds are all separated by mere tenths, and even hundredths, of a second.\n\nZac Stubblety-Cook is the top seed in the event, entered with a time of 59.51, a time that is two one-hundredths shy of the Australian Qualifying Time (AQT) of 59.49.\n\nThe winner will get the Olympic nod for the medley relay anyway, but the biggest battle figures to be a race against the clock—though it’s not outside the realm of possibility that two men go under the mark.\n\nSam Williamson is the #2 seed, entered with a 59.82, while Joshua Yong is currently in the #3 spot with a 59.83, making this race one to watch.\n\nWhile Williamson’s personal best time of 59.21 is faster than Yong’s best time of 59.83, Yong recently defeated Williamson at the Australian Open Championships. Yong threw down a time of 1:00.16 to beat out Williamson’s time of 1:00.87.\n\nMirroring the rankings of the men’s event, the second and third spots in the women’s 100 breast are also separated by only .01.\n\nAbbey Harkin currently sits in the #2 spot on the psych sheet with a 1:06.86, her personal best which she set at the 2023 World Championships, and just behind her is Ella Ramsay, who is entered with a 1:06.87.\n\nHarkin and Ramsay most recently went head-to-head at the Australian Open Championships, where Harkin placed second overall with a season-best time of 1:07.71. Ramsay posted a time of 1:08.24 to take fourth.\n\nThe two will be in hot contention with each other for one of the Olympic spots, especially as they also contend with #1 seed Jenna Strauch (1:06.16).\n\nOf course, the AQT of 1:06.31 means only the winner will go to Paris if two women aren’t under that mark.\n\nThe shorter sprints tend to produce the closest battles for the top spots, and the men’s 100 free lineup certainly promises to do just that at Trials.\n\nThe top two men are sub-48 coming in, with Kyle Chalmers leading the way at 47.15. Flynn Southam is ranked second in a time of 47.77, while Kai Taylor has been as fast as 48.01 this year (though he’s entered at 48.37).\n\nWith up to six swimmers making the Olympic roster in the 100 free for relay purposes, the battle for the remaining spots is sure to be just as intense. The next three swimmers on the psych sheet are nearly dead even with their entry times; William Yang is the #4 seed in 48.20, followed by Jack Cartwright and Maximillian Giuliani, both entered at 48.21.\n\nThe race for the second Olympic spot looks like it will be a tight one in the women’s 200 fly, as the second and third seeds are within four-tenths of each other.\n\nAbbey Connor is currently ranked second with her personal best time of 2:06.59, while Olympic veteran Brianna Throssell is ranked just behind her with a time of 2:06.98, just narrowly off her all-time best time of 2:06.78.\n\nThrossell’s entry time of 2:06.98 was just posted at the Australian Open, where she edged ahead of Connor, who posted a time of 2:07.20. Either way, both are comfortably under the AQT of 2:07.72.\n\nThe showdown in the event will likely be between Connor and Throssell, as 4th seed Bella Grant sits further behind with a time of 2:08.42, but there is always room for surprises at Trials.\n\nElizabeth Dekkers currently leads the field by a decent margin, heading into the meet with a time of 2:05.20.\n\nThe women’s 100 free is shaping up to be a battle to decide who will qualify for the individual event at the Olympics and who will fill the relay spots.\n\nMollie O’Callaghan looks to be locked in for the event, sitting in the top spot with an entry time of 52.16, but the rankings after her are tightly bunched.\n\nEmma McKeon’s seed time of 52.52 puts her in the #2 spot, where she is closely followed by Meg Harris (52.59) and Shayna Jack (52.60). Trailing just slightly further back are Olympic veterans and famed sibling duo Cate and Bronte Campbell, who are seeded fifth (53.23) and sixth (53.30) respectively.\n\nYoungster and reigning World Junior champion Olivia Wunsch is also a significant threat.\n\nThe 50 free is likely to be an even closer battle for the Olympic roster spots since the margin between competitors’ times is even smaller.\n\nMcKeon leads the pack with an entry time of 23.99, the only competitor under 24. She will be dueling for the top spot with Jack, who sits just behind McKeon as the #2 seed with a time of 24.01.\n\nCate Campbell will also be fighting for an Olympic roster spot; she is seeded third with a 24.10 and is trailed by Harris, who is entered with a 24.28. Wunsch is also in the mix.\n\nIt appears as if it will be a fight between Kiah Melverton and Ella Ramsay for the second Olympic spot in the 400 IM.\n\nMelverton is seeded second with a time of 4:36.78, while Ramsay is the #3 seed with a time of 4:36.94.\n\nWhile the 400 IM offers more opportunity for surprise upsets, Melverton and Ramsay have the smallest margin of separation among the top-ranked competitors, making them the most likely to be locked into a tough showdown in the pool.\n\nThe top seed, Jenna Forrester, sits farther ahead of Melverton with an entry time of 4:32.30, while #4 seed Kayla Hardy trails Ramsay with an entry time of 4:44.25.\n\nThe men’s 100 fly promises an exciting showdown to determine who will secure the Olympic roster spots, as the top six ranked swimmers all have times in hot contention with each other.\n\nMatt Temple is the top seed with a time of 50.60 and is the only competitor under 51 on the psych sheet, giving him a decent edge, but there are still no guarantees given the closeness of those after him.\n\nShaun Champion is the #2 seed with a time of 51.28, followed by Kyle Chalmers (51.61), Jesse Coleman (51.66), Ben Armbruster (51.67) and Cody Simpson (51.67).\n\nWith the top six entrants being separated by just hundredths in the seedings, this race will certainly be one to watch at Trials.\n\n\n\nΔ\n\n\n\nΔ\n\nAnyone knows if there will be a livestream for overseas fans ?\n\nLivestream on 9Now. Use VPN\n\nPredictions day 1:\nW 400 free: titmus 3:57,4 pallister 4:00,6\nW 200 im: Mckeown 2:06,85 Ramsay 2:09,3\nM 100 breast: Williamson 59,0 stubletty Cook 59,6\nW 100 fly: Mckeon 55,98 throssel 56,56\nM 400 free: short 3:39/3:40?? Winnington 3:41\n\nWinnington will be quicker than Short at trials because he’s tapering for the 200.\n\nI think it’s just been announced that Michael Bohl will retire after Paris. I wonder where McKeown (and others) will go next??\n\nJanelle Pallister might become head coach. Along with Thomas Fraser-Holmes and a third coach (unsure who) – that would be the coaching group moving forward.\n\nIs this something you’ve heard or just speculating?\n\nPure speculation. I said might. Janelle has been under Bohl’s guidance for a number of years now. Fraser-Holmes has been the coach of the younger swimmers for a while too.\n\nIt’s a not a sure thing. He’s taking a 12 month break before deciding if he’ll retire.\n\nWilliamson was really impressive in Doha. His 50 had me thinking that he must have 58 potential in the 100, which could be huge for the medley relay.\n\nGiuliani or Guiliano\n\nMax Giuliani is Australian.\n\nChris Guiliano is American. Also Guiliano appears to be a misspelled version of Giuliano lol\n\nyou mean chris gilliland, according to giaan rooney?\n\nOof that is much worse misspelling of Giuliano lol\n\nI hope no one will be calling Olivia wench at trials\n\nhopefully neither winch nor woonsich\n\nSpeaking of Woonsich, I hate that the women’s 50 and 100 free are the last 2 days. Get one of them out of the way early. So many swimmers probably have those as their only events.\n\nShannon Rollason was happy on his podcast as it gives Bronte slightly longer to recover from her injury.\n\nShannon Rollason also said the women’s 200 breast will be “the race of the meet” so it’s hard to take him seriously lol\n\nI remember an Aussie swimmer called Nick Ffrost from awhile back. I initially thought it was a typo or keyboard issue. Then I realized well everyone can’t have the same  defective keystroke issue.\n\nAll four freestyle relay events should be good battles. All four with strong medal shots. \n\nMy predictions \n\nW100\nMOC\nJack\nHarris\nMcKeon\nC Campbell\nWunsch (sorry Bronte 😭😭)\n\nW200\nMOC\nTitmus\nPallister\nMcKeown\nThrossell\nJack\n\nM100\nChalmers\nCartwright\nYang\nTaylor\nSoutham\nGiuliani\n\nM200\nGiuliani\nWinnington\nTaylor\nNeill\nSoutham\nIncerti (Graham dark horse, Short will set a significant PB but can’t swim in Paris due to 800 conflict)\n\nWinnington has the same problem as Short so I really wonder what his plan is. If he makes the team in both (which seems likely) will he see how he goes in the 800 heats and if he doesn’t make the final or feels like his chances in the final are poor then prioritise the 4×2?\n\nWinnington isn’t doing anything in the 800. He should drop it and just do the 400. But yeah I’m not sure exactly how he’ll approach it\n\nInteresting call before the trials on Winnington!!!!\n\nYeah pretty good calls here. The most interesting will be the order of these events.\n\nI’m very interested to see who gets second in the men’s 50 and if we can finally go sub 3:40 in the men’s 4free\n\nThere’s a pretty good chance that the top 4 in the women’s 100 free are all 52.3 or faster 💀💀\n\nWill top four be faster than the us winning time?\nWould be funny\n\nI wouldn’t be surprised.\n\nI would say only Kate Douglass can stop the top 4/5 of the Australians girls\n\nAmerican has some fairly decent young girls coming thru, Douglas, Huske, G Walsh, I wouldn’t write them off just yet.\n\nDouglas, Huske, Walsh…are young?\n\nYoungish.\n\nWalsh is older than MOC\n\nI feel like this is a comment from right before the 2021 Olympic Trials.\n\nThere are some predictions like before 2021 Trials as well.\n\nCalling this for the Paris relay\nMOC leads off in 51.8. Shayna/Meg/Emma all split 51s. First sub 52 second relay\n\nYes please\n\nHope they will leave a place to Cate to go for unprecedented 5th consecutive medal. She will still be able to medal as a heat swimmer. But if she is to anchor in the finale it will be a remarkable finale. I thinks Aussie should use 3 different anchor leg swimmers in the relays! i. e. Cate 100 Free, Shayna Mixed Medley, Meg Medley Relay (with MOC/Kaylee/Emma)\n\nMore from Charlotte WellsSee All\n\nSubscribe to our newsletter and receive our latest updates!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSubscribe to SwimSwam Magazine!\n\n\nSubscribe\n\n\n© 2025 Swim Swam Partners, LLC.

Analisi e risultati aggiornati minuto per minuto \n\nJune 07th, 2024  Australia, International, News, Previews & Recaps\n\nWith the 2024 Australian Olympic Trials on the horizon, we’re looking at the different dynamics about to unfold at the Brisbane Aquatic Centre beginning on June 10th.\n\nTo qualify for the Olympic Games, swimmers must be under the qualifying standard set by Swimming Australia and place inside the top two of their event at the Trials (outside of the 100 and 200 free, where up to the top six can be named). The qualifying times put in place by Swimming Australia are faster than the Olympic qualifying times published by World Aquatics.\n\nRather than previewing the meet by event, we’ve opted to focus more on the storylines for the Australian Trials, with the following articles to come:\n\nAustralia has a burgeoning group of youngsters who head into the Trials with plenty of momentum. Some are favored to qualify for the Games, while others, though they are on the outside looking in, have the potential to orchestrate an upset.\n\nIn this article, we’ll take a look at the 20 and under athletes who are in position to qualify for their first Olympic team.\n\nAs a Tokyo Olympian, Isaac Cooper didn’t qualify to be featured here, though the 20-year-old is favored to make his way to Paris as the top seed in the men’s 100 back and the #2 seed in the 50 free.\n\nElizabeth Dekkers, 20\n\nDekkers has established herself as one of the world’s best in the 200 fly over the last few years, winning the Commonwealth Games title in 2022 and following up by snagging silver at the 2023 World Championships.\n\nMost recently, she set a personal best time and new All Comers Record of 2:05.20 at the Australian Open Championships in April, inching past her previous best of 2:05.26 set in 2023.\n\nDekkers, who turned 20 last month, is the big favorite in the women’s 200 fly at the Trials after all of her international success since Tokyo. As a warmup, she should also feature in the final of the 100 fly, though her work will be cut out for her to qualify for the team as the 5th seed (not including Japan’s Rikako Ikee) with a best time (58.26) more than a second back of the qualifying standard (57.17).\n\nAbbey Connor, 19\n\nAlthough she figures to have a battle on her hands with veteran Brianna Throssell, Connor is the frontrunner to snag the second spot in the women’s 200 fly behind Dekkers, having set a lifetime best of 2:06.59 at the New South Wales State Open Championships in March.\n\nThat performance was followed up by a 2:07.20 clocking at the Australian Open Championships the following month, both swims under the AQT of 2:07.72.\n\nA spot on the Olympic team would be a massive turnaround for the USC Spartans-trained swimmer, who signaled her intention to retire at the age of 17 in April 2023.\n\nConnor will also be a threat to make the ‘A’ final in the 200 free and 100 fly in Brisbane.\n\nJenna Forrester, 20\n\nWith Kaylee McKeown opting not to contest the 400 IM at the Olympics despite being one of the fastest swimmers in history, Forrester takes over as Australia’s main medal hopeful in Paris.\n\nForrester, who will turn 21 towards the end of the Trials, broke through in a big way in 2023, roaring to bronze at the World Championships in Fukuoka in a personal best time of 4:32.30.\n\nShe also qualified to represent Australia at the 2023 Worlds in the 200 back and 200 IM, making the final of both races in Fukuoka and landing a 4th-place finish in the medley event.\n\nThe St. Peters Western swimmer is the leading candidate for the second spot behind McKeown at the Trials in the 200 IM (2:08.98 best time), and is also in the hunt in the 200 back and in the 200 free for a relay spot.\n\nIona Anderson, 18\n\nIt might be more appropriate for Anderson to be in the preview for the “flying under the radar” youngsters—not because she’s flying under the radar, but because she has a tough path to the Olympic team—but after what she’s done in recent months, she earns her spot here.\n\nAnderson won silver medals in the 50 and 100 back at the 2024 World Championships in Doha, and captured a world title at the end of the meet when she led off the Australian women’s medley relay to gold.\n\nShe followed that up by clocking a lifetime best of 58.53 in the 100 back in May, a performance that firmly entrenches her into the mix for a spot on the Aussie Olympic team despite the presence of Mollie O’Callaghan on the psych sheets.\n\nWorld record holder and defending champion McKeown is a slam-dunk to take the first roster spot in the event, and O’Callaghan will be hard to beat if she’s in the field as she owns an elite PB of 58.09. There’s a chance O’Callaghan opts out of the event, or withdraws from it at the Olympics after the Trials, as the semis of the 100 back fall during the same session as the 200 free final in Paris. O’Callaghan is the reigning world champion in the 200 free, so that event will be her priority.\n\nAs for Anderson, even if O’Callaghan is racing, she’s certainly got a chance to snag a top-two finish with her constant improvement. However, O’Callaghan’s new best time of 58.09 set in April is scintillating.\n\nRepresenting the WA Breakers, Anderson is much stronger in the 100 back than she is in the 200, but she could still be in the mix to final with her best time of 2:11.40.\n\nJaclyn Barclay, 17\n\nBarclay and Anderson form a dangerous 1-2 teenage punch for Australia in women’s backstroke, though the presence of McKeown makes it a tall order for either to comfortably make the Olympic team.\n\nWhile Anderson’s strength is the 100 back, Barclay’s comes in the longer distance, as the 17-year-old won silver at the 2024 World Championships in the 200 in 2:07.03. That performance makes her the fifth-fastest swimmer in the world this year, trailing only McKeown, Regan Smith, Claire Curzan and Kylie Masse.\n\nDespite being entered with a time (2:08.76) significantly slower than her PB, Barclay is still the #2 seed behind McKeown for the Aussie Trials. Barclay, who swims for St. Peters Western, has also been 59.28 in the 100 back, making her the #4 seed.\n\nMax Giuliani, 20\n\nGiuliani had a massive breakthrough swim last December in the men’s 200 free, clocking 1:44.79 to become the second-fastest Australian of all-time.\n\nThat swim came after he went 1:45.42 on the World Cup circuit in October, and in 2024, he’s been as fast as 1:46.70.\n\nIf the Miami Swim Club-trained Giuliani can be within a second of his best time in the 200 free he should be able to solidify an individual Olympic berth, with at least a relay spot in the cards even if he’s off form. He’s the top seed by more than seven-tenths with Elijah Winnington ranked 2nd at 1:45.53. The AQT sits at 1:45.97.\n\nGiuliani should also feature in the battle for spots in the 100 free with his best time of 48.21.\n\nKai Taylor, 20\n\nTaylor broke through by winning the men’s 200 free at the Aussie Trials in 2023, and set a new PB in Fukuoka in 1:45.79 leading off the Australian men’s 800 free relay that won bronze.\n\nThe 20-year-old has already broken 1:46 this year, clocking 1:45.89 in April to put his name in the hat for another individual berth in the 200 free, though the likes of Giuliani, Winnington, Flynn Southam and Thomas Neill will all be in the hunt.\n\nTaylor also has a strong case that he’s a favorite for an individual spot in the 100 free after setting a PB of 48.01 at the 2024 World Championships.\n\nFlynn Southam, 19\n\nSoutham has put together a decorated international resume since the Tokyo Olympics, winning three relay medals at the 2023 World Championships, five at the 2022 Short Course World Championships, and three (all gold) at the 2022 Commonwealth Games.\n\nThe 19-year-old has long been heralded as Australia’s next great sprint freestyler, and that will be put to the test at the Olympic Trials where he’s favored to qualify for the Games—it just remains to be seen if he can earn an individual spot or if it’s only in the relays.\n\nSoutham has been as fast as 47.77 in the 100 free, which makes him the frontrunner for the #2 spot behind Kyle Chalmers. In the 200 free, he set a best time of 1:46.11 in April, so he’s trending in the right direction heading to Brisbane.\n\nWilliam Petric, 19\n\nPetric doesn’t have the international resume that some of these other names do, but is a strong contender to land a berth in one or both of the men’s medley events.\n\nThe 19-year-old, who represents Nunawading, swam to lifetime bests of 1:58.05 in the 200 IM and 4:12.21 in the 400 IM at the Sydney Open in early May.\n\nHe’s the #2 seeded Australian in both races heading to Trials, though he’s only marginally under the AQT in the 400 IM (4:12.50) and will need to drop time to hit the 200 IM cut (1:57.23).\n\n\n\nΔ\n\n\n\nΔ\n\nI think it would have made sense to feature Sam Short in this article (or discuss the 400 free Short vs Winnington in “The Battles” preview)\n\nO’Callaghan did not go to Doha so she’s not the reigning world champion.\n\nStop it lol\n\nThose contending in multiple events, but only get SA QT in one of event, and WA A in another (and finish top 2), will very likely still qualify for both events.\n\nExample scenarios\nPetric, top 2 400IM gets SAQT / 200IM 1st but WA A\n\nNeill, top 2 200 IM WA A, but qualified for 4×200 relay\n\nDekkers is one that is flying under the radar, she got 2nd in 200 fly in WC 2023 & is improving every year.\nvery interested in what she can go this year.\n\n200 fly will be her only event. Smith, McIntosh and Zhang all have packed schedules leading up to it. If Dekkers can nail it she could sneak right up there against more fatigued swimmers\n\nYes I agree, will be good to see how she goes at trails & at Olympics.\n\nSienna Toohey is one to watch, even if its just to see how close she can get this time, as the real target would be 2028, its just she’s been making gains every time.\n\nGood to see alot of upcoming talent in strokes other than the freestyle\n\nDo we know yet if this will be available to watch in the USA? Last Aussie Olympic trials they put on Amazon prime\n\nYou’ll need a VPN.\nIt’s on 9Now.com.au\n\nThey make you log in as well to watch streaming. So need an email presumably in Australia.\n\nAn Australian email isn’t required but if I remember right you need to enter an Australian postcode when signing up so just use 2000 (Sydney).\n\nYou just need an email address.\n\nI hope Forrester does well but she is a bit of an unknown considering her recent performances. \n\nWatch out for Ella Ramsey 19, in the 100/200 breast and 200/400 IM.\n\nAnother one to watch in the women’s 100 breaststroke is Sienna Toohey 15, she’s just off the pace at 1:07.7 but is improving almost every time she races.\n\nWould love to see Forrester make it but heard recent talk of a possible back injury. Here’s hoping that’s not the case.\n\nTotally agree with the watch on Ramsey and Toohey. \n\nI would add Jesse Coleman in the Men’s 100 fly and Harrison Turner in the Men’s 200 fly to that watch list. QT’s may be a little out of reach for both, but I certainly think both can go top 2 in their respective race.\n\nYes – in what was otherwise an excellent article by James, the lack of current context around Jenna was an obvious omission.\nIf she can get back to top form (hoping so!), that will make a significant difference for Australia in several events.\n\nJames swam five years at Laurentian University in Sudbury, Ontario, specializing in the 200 free, back and IM.

Now the company is adding international flavor to its mix.\n\n\n\tWarner has acquired the U.S. rights to the French Open, the tennis tournament also known as Roland-Garros, according to people familiar with the matter, snatching up a property that has primarily been associated with NBC Sports for many years. In Europe, however, where Warner Bros. Discovery operates the massive Eurosport pay-TV networks, the Open has been part of its offerings since 1989. Warner’s new French Open deal will commence in 2025.\n\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tRelated Stories\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\tVIP+\n\t\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tGaming Holds the Key to Brands Trying to Reach Gen Alpha \t\t\n\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tCannes Directors’ Fortnight: Valéry Carnoy’s ‘Wild Foxes’ Wins Best European Film Prize\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\tThe new pact will give Warner rights to telecast the event in both the U.S. and Europe, according to these people, and brings a new offering to the company’s U.S. portfolio, which features games from the National Hockey League, Major League Baseball and the National Basketball Association, as well as a significant part of the annual March Madness men’s college-basketball tournament. Warner Bros. Discovery intends to make content tied to the Open available across its linear cable networks, its Max streaming service, and its Bleacher Report digital sports hub, according to people familiar with the deal. Warner Bros. Discovery is a co-owner of the new Venu streaming sports joint-venture operated with Fox and Disney, and expected to debut in the fall.\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\tPopular on Variety\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\tWarner Bros. Discovery declined to make executives available for comment. Financial details of the transaction, which is slated to cover a multiple-year run, could not be immediately learned. The French Open has, with the exception of a three-year stint, been televised in the U.S. by NBC since 1983.\n\n\n\tDetails of the pact surface as Warner Bros. Discovery is trying to determine if it can keep some portion of the NBA games that fuel so much of the economics of its TV properties. The NBA‘s current rights deal, held primarily among Warner and Disney, expires after the 2024-2025 season, and the league has set up preliminary carriage deals with Disney, Amazon and NBCUniversal, according to people familiar with those plans. Loss of the NBA is expected to crimp the operations of Warner cable networks like TNT.\n\n\n\tWarner has vowed to grow its sports presence. It has in recent weeks struck a deal to sub-license some CFP games from Disney’s ESPN and built up its ties to the NHL. The company has also tried to expand a series of celebrity-golf tournaments known as “The Match” that have popular golfers and football players taking part, among others.\n\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\tMany investors’ eyes have been on Warner since it was formed from the merger of the former Discovery Inc. and WarnerMedia. Discovery, best known for the unscripted fare it shows on Food Network and Discovery Channel, also owned Eurosport, while Warner had the U.S. sports portfolio. The thought has long been that the company would be able to develop global alliances with various leagues and teams. Eurosport has rights to broadcast the Olympics in Europe.\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\tA Variety and iHeartRadio Podcast\t\t\n\nThe Business of Entertainment"

She was also given the option of releasing a statement that said she was moving on, according to the Athletic. Team sources told the Athletic, \"It's pretty shocking.\"\n\n“The feedback to us was pretty direct and pretty clear that there wasn’t a path forward with the current personnel in place,” Hefford said to the Associated Press during a Zoom interview with select members of the media. “It was with the work we did throughout the year, and it was clear that a change needed to be made.”\n\nHefford said the decision involved more than one person and was part of a year-long process, when asked whether a rift escalated over the season between Darwitz and coach Ken Klee.\n\nKlee declined to comment in a text to The AP. He will continue his role as coach, and serve as interim GM in overseeing Minnesota’s selections in the draft on Monday.\n\nThe decision to remove Darwitz is stunning in timing and significance following the completion of the PWHL’s first season.\n\nDarwitz assembled the team that won the PWHL’s first championship with a 3-0 win over Boston in a decisive Game 5 on May 29. Minnesota reached the final by rallying from a 2-0 first-round series deficit to beat regular-season champion Toronto in a best-of-five playoff final. Darwitz’s dismissal also comes days before Minnesota hosts the PWHL’s second draft on Monday.\n\nThe 40-year-old Darwitz is one of the more recognized faces of Minnesota hockey. From St. Paul, she’s a three-time U.S. Olympian, three-time world champion and was part of a University of Minnesota team that won consecutive NCAA titles in 2004 and ’05.\n\nShe was inducted into the International Ice Hockey Federation’s Hall of Fame this year.\n\n“We completely recognize the iconic status of Natalie Darwitz in the state of Minnesota. Her incredible contributions, to the PWHL, to building a championship team,” Hefford said. “And this is certainly not something that we could have foreseen happening or wanted to happen. But it has led to us and Natalie parting ways.”\n\nKlee is a former NHL defenseman with experience coaching U.S. national women’s teams. He took over as Minnesota coach in late December to replace Charlie Burggraf, who stepped down citing family reasons.\n\nKlee had previously been a finalist for both a PWHL coaching and GM position.\n\nDarwitz was hired in September and signed a one-year contract, which was standard for each of the centralized league’s six GMs and coaches. She then stocked her lineup with a distinct local flavor and representative of Minnesota’s hockey-rich roots.\n\nThe surprising news comes just days before the 2024 PWHL Draft, scheduled for Monday at the Xcel Energy Center.\n\nPWHL and PWHL Minnesota General Manager Natalie Darwitz have parted ways.Full statement: https://t.co/hFmSOuJ0E2 pic.twitter.com/HIHVqcBGOw\n\nA statement released by the PWHL says Klee and his coaching staff will handle the team's selections during Monday's 2024 league draft.

As long as he is there, for me, he remains the best.\n\n“And we saw in his end of the match against Cerundolo that, even injured, when he goes into ‘Djoko mode’, he is almost unbeatable. In fact, he fell to second place in the world due to a health problem. Not on a defeat.”\n\nThe former world No 1 outlined why Djokovic’s absence from the biggest tournaments is such a blow for tennis after the Serb’s injury.\n\n“I think that for him, I’m worried about him playing Wimbledon, to be honest,” Wilander said on Eurosport. “I’m sorry to the tennis world, but the grass is a dangerous surface if you’re trying to come back from meniscus surgery.\n\n“I have to think that the most important tournament for him, for once, is the Olympics, because he hasn’t won the Olympic gold medal and I think he would really like to bring that home to Serbia.\n\n“Of course, winning Wimbledon for an eighth time would be amazing, getting 25 majors, but he’s so young in his body and mind.\n\n“The one thing that is most disappointing for me personally, apart from that Novak is disappointed himself, is that I want to see him here.\n\n“I want to see him push the youngsters, because what he brought to the match against [Lorenzo] Musetti, and what he brought to the match against [Francisco] Cerundolo, the young guys, they don’t really know how to do that.\n\n“How to throw the kitchen sink at everything and everybody and I am not losing without doing that. I think Novak is basically the last guy to really know how to do that, because of his experience. That’s why I’m the most disappointed.”\n\nCarlos Alcaraz and Jannik Sinner’s Grand Slam totals predicted by leading tennis voice\n\n\n                Jannik Sinner paid an emotional tribute to Rafael Nadal after his opening match at Roland Garros.            \n\n\n                \"I was thinking about my end of the road as well when we were watching Rafa having his speech.\"            \n\n\n                Francisco Cerundolo suffered a shock opening round loss that could be significant.             \n\n\n                Fritz is guaranteed to slip down the ATP Rankings after a shock French Open exit.            \n\n© Planet Sport Limited 2025 • All Rights Reserved"

The conditions were tricky and our confidence was an issue,” said Wooi Yik.\n\n“Being confident is very important and we have to learn to fix these things when we get back to training.\n\n“We are done with all the tournaments before the Olympics so all that’s left now is for the training camp and other preparations,” said Wooi Yik.\n\nThe 2020 Tokyo Olympics bronze medallists added that they want to get on the higher podium spot, but work needs to be done before the Paris stint.\n\n“After the loss we have no choice but to go back to training, we need to polish our gameplay and find our rhythm again,” added Wooi Yik.\n\n“Of course we want to do better than bronze this time, but we don’t want to pressure ourselves at the same time.\n\n“We need to focus on the steps in training and fix our gameplay. We are fine physically but we just couldn’t find our game.”\n\nAlthough Aaron-Wooi Yik seemed to be the favourites to win against Po-hsuan-Ling-fang as they had won five of the past six meetings, the Taiwanese pair turned things around and secured their second win against the Malaysians.\n\nPo-hsuan-Ling-fang will now take on Man Wei Chong-Tee Kai Wun in the quarter-finals today after the Malaysians upstaged Danish pair Rasmus Kjaer-Frederik Sogaard 21-18, 19-21, 21-12 in the second round.\n\nThank you for your report!\n\nCopyright © 1995-\n            \n\n Star Media Group Berhad [197101000523 (10894-D)]\n\nBest viewed on Chrome browsers.\n\n\n\nWe would love to keep you posted on the latest promotion.

Plus four courts in 4K UHD on Stan Sport, the home of grand slam tennis.\n\nThe world No.1 - who will drop to at least No.2 by Monday - had to endure a rough run through the tournament, with a 3am finish in his third-round encounter with Lorenzo Musetti after the Italian forced him into five sets.\n\nHe did not have much time to fully recover from his first five-setter, and he went on to tear his meniscus during his last-16 match.\n\n\"It was a joke that they put him out at 10.30pm [against Musetti],\" McEnroe told Eurosport. \"It was a great match, and then it goes to three in the morning. Absurd.\n\n\"Then to have to come back and go through another marathon match. If this doesn't change the mentality of the majors about this type of schedule, I don't know what would, because he's the No.1 player in the world.\n\n\"You got the top seed, arguably the best player that ever lived getting hurt, and that contributed to it. Having to play till three in the morning, you can't tell me that didn't have an effect on his body, his system, or his recovery.\"\n\nDjokovic was supposed to face No.7 seed Casper Ruud, the runner-up each of the past two years in Paris, in the quarter-finals.

Obviously, we are all hoping that he plays [at Wimbledon]. It would be a shame if it exacerbated an already bad situation by having him withdraw.\"\n\nMcEnroe said how scheduling played a role in Djokovic's injury was \"a bad look\" and \"a black eye for our sport\" while questioning certain decisions by organisers, namely moving Grigor Dimitrov's third-round match against Zizou Bergs from Court 14 to Court Philippe-Chatrier, as the tournament tried to catch up for lost time due to significant rain delays.\n\n\"Does LeBron James play the NBA finals at three in the morning? There's [been] a lot of rain, and they were trying to catch up, but they didn't need to put Grigor Dimitrov on that court. That just put everything off.\n\n\"I don't know what they were thinking, other than they just wanted to get through. What did they think, that the other guy [Bergs] would just roll over and not try, or something? \"So the whole thing was, it's a black eye for our sport, truthfully.\"\n\nDjokovic posted to social media to give fans an update on his condition and thanked them for their \"overwhelming support.\"\n\n\"In the past day, I had to make some tough decisions after sustaining a meniscus tear during my last match. I'm still processing it all but I am happy to update you that the surgery went well. I am so appreciative of the team of doctors who have been by my side,\" Djokovic wrote.\n\n\"I'm going to do my best to be healthy and fit to return to the court as soon as possible\". \"My love for this sport is strong and the desire to compete at the highest level is what keeps me going.\"\n\nIt is unclear exactly how long his recovery will take and when he will be able to play next.\n\nWimbledon, where he has won seven of his 24 grand slam titles, begins on July 1.

As such, expect plenty of frantic rumours but little in the way of actual movement when the transfer window opens in a week’s time.\n\nAn example is today’s Ederson tumult, as the Brazilian was claimed to be subject of a soon-to-be-finalised 45m bid from Liverpool around six PM, then mooted as barely even on the shortlist less than three hours later. \n\nA well-rounded ball winner and passer with a considerable physical presence, the Atalanta man was hugely impressive in the Bergamo side’s road to Europa League gold, as he anchored a midfield that handily outfought both of the competition’s favourites, Liverpool and Bayer Leverkusen, and his development this season should make him a valid option for a number of clubs that are considered a step above Gian Piero Gasperini’s outfit. \n\nAccording to reporters closer to Merseyside than French outlet SPORTS ZONE, though, not Liverpool.

I am so appreciative of the team of doctors who have been by my side as well as the overwhelming support I have received from my fans.\n\n“I’m going to do my best to be healthy and fit to return to the court as soon as possible. My love for this sport is strong and the desire to compete at the highest level is what keeps me going.”\n\nWhile the seven-time champion has yet to pull out of Wimbledon, it seems highly unlikely that he will be fit for a tournament that gets underway on July 1.\n\nDjokovic will be hoping to make it back on court to play at the Paris Olympic Games, as he has stated his drive to win a gold medal for Serbia is the last big target in his trophy-laden career.\n\nYet Roddick has suggested the meniscus injury Djokovic has suffered will not only rule him out of Wimbledon and the Olympics but may force him to consider ending his 2024 season and focusing on one final push to win more titles next year.\n\n“He has had surgery and a lot will depend on how bad the tear is,” he said on the Served with Andy Roddick podcast. “When I was 17, I tore my meniscus, obviously that is a younger body and played on it for like four or five months.\n\n﻿\n\n“Did it again a few months back and I just rested up, but the difference is I don’t have to play Wimbledon in a month.\n\n“This surgery, at least based on every kind I’ve seen and including my own, puts the Olympics out and puts Wimbledon seriously at risk.\n\n“It’s not just a case of saying my knee is okay in a month because you have to train and especially Novak.\n\n“Your special sauce is being able to grind people down, stay in rallies, move people from side to side and ask the question over and over again.\n\n“Novak needs his wheels. He needs his defensive skills. He is probably the best defensive player in the history of tennis and with defence, you rely on your legs.”\n\nRoddick went on to suggest it may not just be Wimbledon and the Olympics at risk for Djokovic, as he suggested he may even call time on the 2024 season.\n\n“Bet against the greats at your at own peril but when someone is 37 and you start having surgery on your knees, it’s a problem,” the American said on his Served With Andy Roddick Podcast.\n\n“A torn meniscus in your knee is not a massive thing when you are 24, 25, 26, but the timing of this sucks. It’s the shortest time of the year for a turnaround.\n\n“I’d say grass is his best surface right now and the worst surface for the guys he’s going against.\n\n“If he pulls out in two weeks, that’s bad. That also puts the US Open in jeopardy and he could just put a wrap on this season and have one final push next year. Let’s get healthy for next year.\n\n“The classy thing to do is if you know there is no chance of playing, you haven’t hit a tennis ball or do any fitness, the best thing he could do for the field is to pull out before the (Wimbledon) draw is made.”\n\nRoddick also dismissed the theory that Djokovic needs to win an Olympic gold medal to complete his legacy as he added: “I’ve seen the argument saying that if he doesn’t win the Olympic gold medal, it changes everything.\n\n“No it doesn’t. It’s one tournament every four years in a random place that is wedged into the season. It’s just not the same for tennis players (as other athletes).\n\n“For tennis players to pretend it’s the same as any other Olympic athlete that might also have a job at Home Depot is crazy town.\n\n“It might be important for Novak, but the Olympics does not mean the same to tennis players as it does for other athletes.”\n\n\n                Francisco Cerundolo suffered a shock opening round loss that could be significant.             \n\n\n                \"I was thinking about my end of the road as well when we were watching Rafa having his speech.\"            \n\n\n                Fritz is guaranteed to slip down the ATP Rankings after a shock French Open exit.            \n\n\n                Chris Evert has given a brutal assessment of Novak Djokovic's French Open chances.            \n\n© Planet Sport Limited 2025 • All Rights Reserved"

Please try again later.\n\nThis was published 11 months ago\n\nAdd articles to your saved list and come back to them any time.\n\nAmerican Olympic champion Rowdy Gaines has hailed the unprecedented strength of Australia’s swimming team ahead of the Paris Olympics, believing the Dolphins are poised to top the medal table over their fierce USA rivals for the first time in 68 years.\n\nAustralia stunned the USA at last year’s world swimming championships in Japan by topping the medal table with 13 gold medals, seven silvers and five bronzes.\n\nThe USA managed just seven gold medals, which was their lowest world championship haul since the four they won in 1994. They did win a whopping 20 silver medals in Fukuoka but were consistently pipped by the likes of Ariarne Titmus, Kaylee McKeown, Cam McEvoy, Kyle Chalmers and Australia’s relay teams.\n\nAustralia has not topped an Olympic swimming medal table since the 1956 Games in Melbourne.\n\nThe Dolphins won more gold medals (nine) at the last Olympics in Tokyo than ever before.\n\nSpeaking on Channel Nine’s new documentary Boiling Point - Swimming’s Greatest Rivalry, which airs on Sunday night, Gaines has conceded Team USA will have their work cut out in Paris.\n\n“Right now, Australia is going to win the most gold medals,” said Gaines, who famously edged out Australia’s Mark Stockwell for gold in the men’s 100m freestyle at the 1984 Olympics.\n\n“In the history of swimming, the biggest rivalry of all is Australia and the United States.\n\n“With Australia, we hate them before, but we love them after. It’s this brotherly love … because you want to beat your brother but then you’re going to give them a big hug afterwards.”\n\nGaines’ prediction comes as former Australian swimming stars Giaan Rooney and Michael Klim talked up the team’s chances of creating history.\n\nAmerican swimming commentator and Olympian Rowdy Gaines in Nine’s new documentary Boiling Point - Swimming’s Greatest Rivalry. Credit: Nine\n\nRooney, a two-time Olympian and commentator for Nine at next week’s Olympic swimming trials in Brisbane, said Gaines’ admission in the documentary was telling.\n\nAsked if she agreed that Australia could beat the USA on the medal table, Rooney said: “I do. We are genuine contenders to win the medal podium in the swimming events in Paris.\n\n“It does add kudos when someone like Rowdy Gaines says it. Americans aren’t one to deflect and take the pressure off them. They will only make a statement like that if it’s actually a chance of happening. For Rowdy to say that based off world championship results last year [says a lot].\n\n“I’ve never been one to jinx the team or put too much pressure or expectation on them, but I believe this team is such an experienced swim team they can handle that pressure and expectation. They’re fine with it. I honestly believe all the stars are aligning at these Olympics to produce one of our most successful swim teams ever.\n\nKyle Chalmers won gold in the men’s 100 metres freestyle at the world championships last year in Fukuoka. Credit: Getty\n\n“The Americans were absolutely floored by our Aussie performances [in Japan]. For NBC to change the medal tally [at last year’s world championships] ... to show the total number of medals instead of gold medals [as the top nation], it speaks volumes. In some ways, it has ignited that USA-Australia rivalry like never before.”\n\nKlim, whose heroics are featured in the documentary as a member of Australia’s gold medal-winning men’s 4x100m freestyle relay team at Sydney 2000, says this Dolphins squad has a chance of doing what many thought impossible a few years ago when Australia won just one gold medal in the pool at the 2012 London Olympics.\n\nAustralia’s six-day Olympic trials start on Monday, ahead of the Olympic program that gets under way on July 27 in Paris.\n\n“We definitely have the opportunity [to beat the USA] but the Olympic Games is a completely different kettle of fish,” Klim said. “It’s going to be tougher than ever before. We have that opportunity. It’s not going to be easy.”\n\nAshley Callus, Chris Fydler, Michael Klim and Ian Thorpe celebrate their gold in the 4x100m relay at Sydney 2000. The Australians set a world record of 3:13.67 while Klim also broke the individual world record, finishing his leg in 48.18s.

Notably (apart from Mbappe’s domination), Eduardo Camavinga spoke to the media after the match. Having played just one minute off the bench due to a well-deserved rest following the Champions League Final four days prior, Camavinga shared his thoughts on various topics, including his role with Real Madrid next season, the Olympic Games, and more.\n\nAddressing his absence from the Olympic Games, Camavinga stated, “It would have been an honor to play in the Olympic Games but it is not possible. We must accept Real Madrid’s choice and move forward.” \n\nCamavinga also touched upon his status at Real Madrid and how his recent successes might influence his role. “I don’t think my status (next season) will change because I have won two Champions Leagues. It shouldn’t change. When you win trophies, you have extra confidence. You always feel good in your head and then your feet follow,” he remarked. \n\n\n\nWhat do you see Camavinga's role next season being with Mbappe arriving / Kroos leaving? pic.twitter.com/l9W47H9I8w\n\n\n\nThe young midfielder also praised his teammate Kylian Mbappé, highlighting an often-overlooked aspect of his game. “People don’t necessarily see Mbappé’s qualities as a passer,” he said. “I don’t know what Ancelotti thinks, he will make the right decisions to align everyone. We will see next season.” \n\nFinally, Camavinga shared his feelings about winning the Champions League twice. \n\n“You never get used to winning the Champions League, it’s my second, but there are people who have won six,” Camavinga explained. “The first always has a special and different flavor, but it’s always nice to win titles. The first time I played a lot... This time I have won as a starter, but let’s say that the first time was better, even though it is more pleasant to be a starter.”\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA post shared by Managing Madrid (@managingmadrid)\n\nCheck your inbox for a welcome email.\n\nOops.

I think when ICC advertised for ticket registration, nearly 2 million requests just came for the India-Pakistan game. Unfortunately, it’s hard to accommodate everyone,” Pisike had told The Indian Express.\n\nHowever, the ground reality is that the game isn’t sold out with just over two days to go. India’s opening match against Ireland too received a subdued reception with most of the stands having a large number of empty seats.\n\nAshish Kumar Gupta, an IT engineer in Pennsylvania, went for India’s warm-up match against Bangladesh in New York but said he couldn’t get tickets for the June 9 game against Pakistan. “The cost of one ticket for the warm-up match was $118, while the starting rate of the India vs Pakistan match is $300, and it had been gobbled up. At present only hospitality tickets are available, but are fetching between $2500-$10,000,” says Gupta.\n\nBy late Thursday, there are plenty of tickets available for the Diamond Club ($10,000), Corner Clubs ($2,750) and Premium Club Lounge ($2,500). The rates of the premium seats during the India vs Ireland tie were $7,500 for the Diamond Club, $950 for the Corner Club and $1,750 for the Premium Club lounge.\n\nOn Tuesday, ICC released additional tickets for some T20 World Cup matches, including the India-Pakistan game, following huge demand from fans. And by late Tuesday, the general admission tickets, starting at $300, were not available.\n\nThe general admission tickets in the resale market are hovering at around from $1200 to $1400 each, which is half the average monthly earnings of lower-income Asian households in the US. To put matters in perspective, the median monthly income of lower-income Asian households is $2,625, and for the middle-income category $9,300, according to a Pew Research paper published last year.\n\n“The cheapest tickets for the India-Pakistan game got sold out in no time. The rest were very expensive, in the $2000-$2500 range. Then you need to find a hotel, air or train tickets to reach New York and other expenses. It could have cost me $4000-$4500 easily. So I dropped the plan,” S Adarsh, an IT professional living in Seattle told this newspaper.\n\nJamie Harrison, a history teacher, who set up the first American high school cricket team outside of New York City said: “If the American cricket board wanted to take the game mainstream, they should have reduced the prices of the tickets. Suppose a person who doesn’t know cricket wants to get a hang of the game, he has to shell out $200-300. So, he’s not likely to buy a ticket. This way, America would not get new cricket fans. Only those who know the game would bother to spend this much. Even for those who like the game, it’s not affordable for all.”\n\nLong-term view\n\nFor ICC, a lot depends on the June 9 fixture in terms of how cricket will leave a mark in the US. In four years’ time, the sport will make its comeback into the Olympic fold at the Los Angeles Games after an absence of over a century. Cricket was last played at the Olympics at Paris in 1900, when just two teams competed: France and Great Britain.\n\nEarlier this year, IOC chief Thomas Bach had said he was a “fan” of the T20 format and wanted to cash in on the popularity of the sport among the Indian community in the US.\n\n“I’m a fan of T20 cricket. What speaks in favour of the sport is that it has been gaining more and more international representation. With T20, there is a format available that can be played in an Olympic Games. (It) is a format which is of interest to more countries. We see that interest in cricket is not only limited to countries where it is already played but also in the USA, which has a growing Indian community, so you have huge potential there,” Bach had said.\n\n“The sport has a certain representation in all five continents. This is not necessarily true for every sport that we have on the Olympic programme. So this is a good space to develop it further within the continents. If we’re talking about 2028, there is time to grow,” he added.\n\nJoseph O’Neill, who wrote Netherland, a gripping novel in the backdrop of the 9/11 terrorist attacks with a cricket-loving Trinidadian as its protagonist, said high ticket rates will always be a barrier for the growth of the game in the USA.\n\n“I wanted to take my daughter to the (India-Pakistan) game, but the tickets were quite expensive, something like $300-$400 for the cheapest ones. So I bought tickets for the Ireland games, which were far more affordable, $70-$80. I don’t know how the majority of the South Asian diaspora in New York would manage to buy such expensive tickets,” said the author.\n\n Pratyush Raj is a sports journalist with The Indian Express Group and specializes in breaking news stories and conducting in-depth investigative reports for the paper.

I was leading in the second game but their cheers helped Jonatan come back and win.\n\n“In the third game, although it looked like an easy win for me and I was leading by a few points, I had to stay calm and focus on each point,” added Jun Hao.\n\nHe has been showing steady improvement since helping Malaysia win bronze in the Thomas Cup Finals in Chengdu last month and is out to maintain his form.\n\n“I have managed to find some consistency and I have been gaining more confidence since the Thomas Cup. I hope I can continue this,” said Jun Hao.\n\nJun Hao has another tough hurdle in the second round today against Taiwan’s world No. 11 Chou Tien-chen.\n\nTien-chen defeated teammate Lin Chun-yi 21-17, 21-14 in his opening match.\n\nThe Taiwanese will start as the favourite against Jun Hao as he has won in their only encounter so far in the Spain Masters in March.\n\nRESULTS (Malaysians only)\n\nFirst round\n\nMalaysians onlyMen’s singles: Leong Jun Hao bt Jonatan Christie (Ina) 21-13, 16-21, 21-12.\n\nWomen’s doubles: Yeung Nga Ting-Yeung Pui Lam (Hkg) bt Vivian Hoo-Lim Chiew Sien 21-17, 21-18.\n\nMixed doubles: Jiang Zhenbang-Wei Yaxin (Chn) bt Yap Roy King-Valeree Siow 19-21, 21-13, 21-18.\n\n \n\nThank you for your report!\n\nCopyright © 1995-\n            \n\n Star Media Group Berhad [197101000523 (10894-D)]\n\nBest viewed on Chrome browsers.\n\n\n\nWe would love to keep you posted on the latest promotion.

        "expanded content": "\n      With only weeks until the Games start, expect more to come, Microsoft says.\n    \n\nLast year, a feature-length documentary purportedly produced by Netflix began circulating on Telegram. Titled “Olympics have Fallen” and narrated by a voice with a striking similarity to that of actor Tom Cruise, it sharply criticized the leadership of the International Olympic Committee. The slickly produced film, claiming five-star reviews from The New York Times, Washington Post, and BBC, was quickly amplified on social media. Among those seemingly endorsing the documentary were celebrities on the platform Cameo.\n\nA recently published report by Microsoft (PDF) said the film was not a documentary, had received no such reviews, and that the narrator's voice was an AI-produced deep fake of Cruise. It also said the endorsements on Cameo were faked. The Microsoft Threat Intelligence Report went on to say that the fraudulent documentary and endorsements were only one of many elaborate hoaxes created by agents of the Russian government in a yearlong influence operation intended to discredit the International Olympic Committee (IOC) and deter participation and attendance at the Paris Olympics starting next month.\n\nOther examples of the Kremlin’s ongoing influence operation include:\n\nMembers of the Microsoft Threat Analysis Center—a team that tracks hacking and influence campaigns of nation-state actors—have attributed most of the activity to two distinct groups tracked under the names Storm-1679 and Storm-1099. Both groups have spent years sowing Kremlin talking points in Western media.\n\n“Starting in June 2023, prolific Russian influence actors—which Microsoft tracks as Storm-1679 and Storm-1099—pivoted their operations to take aim at the 2024 Olympic Games and French President Emmanuel Macron,” MTAC members wrote. “These ongoing Russian influence operations have two central objectives: to denigrate the reputation of the IOC on the world stage; and to create the expectation of violence breaking out in Paris during the 2024 Summer Olympic Games.”\n\nThe campaigns are only the latest attempt by the Russian government to discredit or hamper the mission of the IOC. Russian agents have also been behind a long line of campaigns targeting past Olympics, including:\n\nOf the two Russian groups attempting to influence perceptions of the 2024 Olympics, Storm-1679 has been the most active, Microsoft said. Previously, the group primarily targeted the Ukrainian refugee community living in the US and Europe. The group's principal tactic was the spoofing of short-form videos and other content—usually in English—that mimicked reputable media outlets. Since the pivot to France and the Olympics, the group has produced content in French, German, and other European languages.\n\nMicrosoft wrote:\n\nStorm-1679’s Olympics-focused disinformation goes beyond defaming the IOC and seeks to foment public fear to deter spectators from attending the Games. Over the past year, Storm-1679 has consistently produced a collection of deceptive videos, suggesting that legitimate and trusted sources are conveying accurate information regarding expected violence during the Paris Games. In a short video, masquerading as a clip from Brussels-based media outlet Euro News, Storm-1679 falsely claimed that Parisians were buying property insurance in anticipation of terrorism surrounding the Games. In another spoofed news clip, this time impersonating French broadcaster France24, Storm-1679 falsely claimed that 24% of purchased tickets for Olympic events had been returned due to similar fears of terrorism. In a more explicit attempt to dissuade citizens from attending the Games, Storm-1679 produced fake video press releases posing as the American Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) and the French General Directorate for Internal Security (DGSI) warning potential attendees to stay away from the Paris 2024 Olympics due to the alleged risk of a terror attack.\n\nThe report continued:\n\nThe most worrisome disinformation advanced by pro-Russian actors has sought to impersonate militant organizations and fabricate threats to the Games amidst the Israel-Hamas conflict. During fall 2023, Storm-1679-linked social media accounts posted images claiming to show graffiti painted in Paris that threatened violence against Israelis attending the 2024 Games. In several of the images, Storm-1679 referenced the attacks at the 1972 Munich Olympics, where members of Black September—an affiliate of the Palestine Liberation Organization—killed 11 members of the Israeli Olympic team and a West German police officer. Microsoft did not observe any independent confirmation that the graffiti physically exists, suggesting the images were likely digitally generated. Separately, in November 2023, a Russian-language X (formerly Twitter) account posted a video purportedly produced by the Turkish ultranationalist organization the Grey Wolves, which included imagery from the 1972 Munich Games attacks, hinting at similar attacks at Paris 2024. The video caused significant confusion online in the hours after it was posted, many assuming it to be authentic, and even prompted a response from the Israeli Olympic Committee. Microsoft does not presently have enough information to attribute the video to a specific actor, but its heavy amplification by pro-Russian bot accounts suggests the video may be another operation in the broader Olympics campaign.\n\nWith a little more than a month until the scheduled start of the Summer Olympics, Microsoft said it’s likely the influence campaigns will only ramp up. Besides being wary of fake content, the company advises looking out for online discussions, trending hashtags, and other online activity produced by generative AI.\n\n\n    Listing image:\n    Microsoft\n  \n\nArs Technica has been separating the signal from\n          the noise for over 25 years.

Up in Canada, though, F1 has been extremely stable since it was first introduced.\n\nBut why? Canada and the United States share a border, a language, a continent, and, in many cases, their racing series; they also both feature plenty of citizens enamored by the throaty roar of an automobile at speed. We’re delving into the long history of the Canadian Grand Prix to understand what makes it such an iconic North American event.\n\nFormula 1’s version of the Canadian Grand Prix got its start at Mosport Park in Ontario, Canada back in 1967 — though it was included on the F1 calendar as a non-championship race all the way back in 1961.\n\nBy contrast, the United States was already on its third venue, Watkins Glen, which joined the calendar in 1961. The event swapped between Mosport and Mont-Tremblant for four years before settling at Mosport for an additional six events.\n\nHowever, by the late 1970s, it had become clear that the track was lacking in safety features, and after an extended battle between sponsors and different potential host cities, Montreal emerged as the ideal location for a race. The manmade Île Notre-Dame had been built to host Expo 67 and had later been used to host certain 1976 Summer Olympics events. By combining existing roads and erecting pit buildings, a Formula 1 track was born.\n\nThe first Montreal Grand Prix was run in 1978 and was won by Quebec racing hero Gilles Villeneuve, firmly establishing the first of the circuit’s many myths that have, over time, combined to tell the story of a fantastic event. When Villeneuve was killed soon after, the track was renamed in his honor; he remains the only Canadian driver to win an F1 race on his home soil.\n\nThe legends have only compounded. The “Wall of Champions” has ruined the races of some of F1’s most iconic drivers. Michael Schumacher and Lewis Hamilton proved their skill at the event by winning time and again.\n\nJenson Button’s truly unforgettable 2011 win was well earned, making history as being the longest F1 race of all time thanks to red flag periods and heavy rain; Button himself started in last place and fought his way to victory.\n\n👉 Wall of Champions explained: How one Canadian Grand Prix corner gained its fearsome name\n\n👉 Red Bull ‘on the backfoot’ as three ‘exciting’ Canadian GP dynamics identified\n\n👉 Five Canadian GP questions: Red Bull to struggle, McLaren’s bogey circuit and what next for Esteban Ocon?\n\n\n\nThe Circuit Gilles Villeneuve is perhaps the ideal North American venue; for as much as this continent adores its sporting events, it can be a challenge to get visitors to the race track while keeping them close enough to a city for the off-track parties. It can also be a challenge to maintain purpose-built sporting facilities in light of rapidly shifting local governments.\n\nF1’s Montreal track is almost perfect. Located on the Île Notre-Dame — effectively, an artificial island turned into a public park — the Circuit Gilles Villeneuve benefits from being several things at the same time.\n\nTechnically, it is a street course, but because the island is transformed into an F1 haven for the Grand Prix, it carries with it a sense of seclusion that you generally only find in older purpose-built tracks.\n\nBut even though the track is isolated, it’s still easily accessible. Fans can drive into the circuit to park, or they can take public transportation; Montreal’s subway system is already equipped with a stop on the Île Notre-Dame.\n\nThe lines can get congested during a race weekend, but it’s a very cheap and efficient way to commute to the track.\n\nThat then means teams, drivers, and fans can stay in the city of Montreal itself without having to worry about waking up early for a long trek to a middle-of-nowhere race track.\n\nAccommodations range from luxury hotels to ultra-cheap hostels, which means fans of all stripes can afford a trip. And when the day at the track is over, it’s easy to head back to your hotel, grab a shower, and then hit the town for dinner and drinks.\n\nBut a race’s success often has very little to do with the fans who attend; instead, local residents and governments have plenty of sway. All of the Canadian GP’s positives for fans, though, also make for positives for locals.\n\nThe Île Notre-Dame is far enough outside of the actual city of Montréal that it doesn’t cause a ton of downtown disturbances, both in terms of traffic congestion and noise from the cars. It’s also close enough that local businesses are flooded with customers.\n\nAnyone who doesn’t want to deal with any Grand Prix nonsense need only leave the city for a weekend.\n\nPlus, Tourism Montreal CEO Yves Lalumière recently pointed out that the Canadian Grand Prix accounts for a little over two percent of all tourism spending in the city — but that there have been significant upticks in both the number of tickets on offer by promoters, and in the duration of F1-related stays. Many visitors are domestic attendees, but the race has also pinned Montreal to the map as a destination of interest for international travelers, even outside of the race weekend.\n\nGlenn Castanheira, executive director at sociétés de développement commercial Montréal centre-ville, added in the Montreal Gazette, “It’s literally Christmas in June for a tremendous amount of businesses downtown and outside of downtown.\n\n”We all know just how difficult it is to operate a business. High rent, high taxes, correct, but also the surprise construction sites that affects the sales for months on end, the unexpected protests that translates into sales being lost, the unexpected weather change or consumer habits. All those things have impacts on our businesses being able to survive or not.\n\n“So a successful Grand Prix normally translates into all these businesses being able to withstand the unexpected that makes doing business so difficult the rest of the year.”\n\nFormula 1 has never hosted a similar event in the United States. Early Grands Prix at Sebring and Riverside fell apart due to promoter problems.\n\nWatkins Glen served as a longtime home for F1, but organizers struggled to raise the funds to maintain the track — in large part because the track is so far away from any major city.\n\nEvents in Phoenix, Detroit, and Dallas, and at Caesars Palace in Las Vegas, were poorly organized races on boring tracks. Indianapolis had a chance at establishing F1’s American foothold, but a quick succession of events including the 9/11 terrorist attacks, the disastrous 2005 tire debacle, and the 2008 financial crisis killed a race that had only started to find its footing.\n\nNow, big races like the Miami and Las Vegas Grands Prix are stunning spectacles — but both boast high ticket prices and have arrived on the scene with ample amounts of local backlash.\n\nThe USGP in Austin and the Long Beach Grand Prix are as close as F1 has come to establishing a long-standing, competent event in America.\n\nWhen F1 first arrived at Long Beach, the region was close enough to Los Angeles as to be easily accessible, but the town itself simply couldn’t afford to maintain a high-profile event. Austin has thrived thanks to smart track management and state subsidies — but the moment either of those two factors fumble, the future of the event gets rocky.\n\nStill, as North American interest in Formula 1 continues to grow, the United States could strongly benefit in turning its eye to its cousins above the northern border.\n\nThe Canadian Grand Prix at Montreal was something of a happy accident — it wasn’t a track that required years of planning, nor was it ever really a first choice for an event — but it just so happens that all the various elements of that event worked in a way that future-proofed the event from countless factors: frustrated locals, growing cities, evolving government, much-needed track maintenance, and more.\n\nIt’s a foolproof formula; organizers of the next US race would do well to study it.\n\nRead next: Why Sergio Perez’s new Red Bull contract is a big deal for North America\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n© Planet Sport Limited 2025 • All Rights Reserved"

But that left the remaining hopefuls battling against each other for seats on the plane to France.\n\nOn Wednesday night came the news that Taylor Spivey, Kirsten Kasper and Seth Rider will claim the three remaining spots as Team USA prepares for the biggest test of all in short-course racing.\n\nFor Spivey in particular the moment will be especially sweet after the pain of agonisingly missing out on a place at Tokyo in 2021.\n\nThe news means though that it is pain this time for Tokyo individual bronze medalist Katie Zaferes and 2016 Olympic champion Gwen Jorgensen.\n\nIt would appear the selectors gave most weight to that key race at WTCS Yokohama last month, where Spivey finished fourth and Kasper fifth.\n\nThe selectors meanwhile left out their top ranked male for the second consecutive Games, with Matt McElroy failing to win a place. That despite McElroy finishing 13th in Yokohama with Rider 26th.\n\n“This is an extremely talented and decorated team that brings a wealth of medal potential and experience into the Games,” said Scott Schnitzspahn, USA Triathlon High Performance General Manager.\n\n“We have several athletes capable of earning an Olympic medal both in the individual events in Paris and in the Mixed Relay, and we are excited to see what they can accomplish. The depth of talent among our U.S. athletes is incredible, with more individuals deserving of a nod than spots available. \n\n“I want to acknowledge the difficult decisions the Games Athlete Selection Panel faced to finalize this talented team. The future of Triathlon and our U.S. athletes is bright and we are all looking forward to seeing what unfolds this summer and beyond.” \n\n“These exceptional athletes represent the sport of Triathlon at its best – their strength, resilience and commitment to excellence is unmatched,” said Victoria Brumfield, USA Triathlon CEO. \n\n“These athletes set their sights on Paris and knew exactly what it would take to get there. Throughout the entire selection period, these athletes have demonstrated unparalleled dedication, perseverance, and raw talent earning their place on the world stage through relentless hard work and unwavering drive. We are thrilled to support them as they pursue Olympic glory in Paris. \n\n“Personally, I could not be more proud to congratulate this incredible team who has ignited the spark in all of us to chase our dreams. We will all be cheering you on in Paris.” \n\nThe USA team for Paris then, looks like this:\n\nA triathlete since childhood, Knibb grew up doing triathlons with her mother, Leslie, who is a longtime triathlete and triathlete coach. Knibb raced in USA Triathlon’s youth and junior elite circuit while running for her school’s cross-country and track teams (Sidwell Friends School in Washington, D.C.) and swimming with Nation’s Capital Swim Club. \n\nShe won the 2016 and 2017 Junior World Championships and the 2018 Under-23 World Championships — one of just three women to capture world titles at both the Junior and U23 levels. Knibb is a 2020 graduate of Cornell University, where she ran NCAA track and cross-country for four years while balancing her elite triathlon career. \n\nShe also joined the Cornell swim team her senior year. Knibb has earned 29 World Triathlon podiums, including 14 wins. She lives and trains in Boulder, Colorado, and is coached by Dan Lorang.  \n\nSpivey, 33, is one of the most consistent elite triathletes in the world, finishing the World Triathlon Championship Series fourth in 2023 and 2022. She makes her Olympic debut in Paris.  \n\nSpivey has earned 14 World Triathlon podiums during her career and has been a key member of the U.S. Mixed Relay team. She was on the U.S. team that won silver at the 2020 Mixed Relay World Championships and the Mixed Relay World Championships bronze medal team in 2022. \n\nKasper, 32, will make her Olympic debut in Paris. She was introduced to triathlon in 2014 through USA Triathlon’s Collegiate Recruitment Program, which identifies top NCAA runners and/or swimmers who have the potential to excel as triathletes. Kasper had a standout running career at NCAA Division I Georgetown University where she was a scoring member of the 2011 D1 NCAA Cross Country National Championships team. While at Georgetown, she received her bachelor’s degree in marketing and management, then she earned her master’s degree in sports management.  \n\nShe saw immediate success when began her triathlon career in 2014 being named USA Triathlon Rookie of the Year. For years, Kasper has been a key member of the U.S. Mixed Relay team. She was a member of the 2016 Mixed Relay World Championships gold medal team, the Mixed Relay World Championships silver medal team in 2017 and the Mixed Relay World Championships bronze medal team in 2018. Kasper is a 17-time World Triathlon podium finisher.  \n\nParis 2024 will be Pearson’s second Olympic Games. He made his Olympic debut in Tokyo, anchoring the U.S. Mixed Relay team that won silver. One of triathlon’s best runners, Pearson, 30, is originally from Spring Lake, New Jersey, where he grew up as a competitive swimmer, ocean lifeguard and promising high school runner. He ran cross-country and track & field at the University of Colorado at Boulder, where he was a seven-time All-American. After winning the overall title at the USA Triathlon Age Group Sprint National Championships in 2017, he debuted as an elite triathlete in 2018.  \n\nPearson’s big breakout happened in 2021, when he won bronze at the World Triathlon Championship Series Yokohama, punching his ticket to the Tokyo Olympics. He followed that with a bronze at the World Triathlon Championship Series Leeds, becoming the first U.S. male triathlete to earn multiple World Triathlon Championship Series medals. He’s earned two more medals at the World Triathlon Championship Series level: the 2022 Championship Finals in Abu Dhabi and the 2024 World Triathlon Championship Series Yokohama this May when he earned his first WTCS gold.  \n\nRider, 27, will make his Olympic debut in Paris. Growing up near Memphis, Tennessee, Rider is a lifelong triathlete who watched his father and brothers compete in triathlon. He started racing triathlon at 6-years-old and came up through USA Triathlon’s Youth and Junior elite triathlon circuit, and hasn’t stopped since. In 2014, Rider represented the U.S. at the Youth Olympic Games and in 2015 he won the USA Triathlon Junior Elite National Championships.  \n\nHe was named USA Triathlon’s 2018 U23 Athlete of the Year and has been a member of the U.S. Elite Triathlon National Team since 2019. He has been a key member of the U.S. Mixed Relay Team, helping the team win bronze at the 2022 Mixed Relay World Championships. Rider has also raced off-road mountain biking triathlons, placing fourth at the 2021 XTERRA World Championships. \n\nFollow the madness of the 'Race that eats its young' on RUN247\n\nThe home of endurance sports"

Fernandez will miss more than two weeks of Maresca's first pre-season if Argentina go all the way to the final, and he would have missed the 2024/25 preparations in their entirety if he subsequently jetted off to the Olympics.\n\nChelsea are under pressure to improve next term after failing to find a winning recipe under a succession of managers. Pochettino led them to sixth in the Premier League last season but more still is expected from their expensively assembled squad.\n\n\n\nMudryk, who cost Chelsea £88.5million in January last year, managed only five goals and two assists in the Premier League last season. Fernandez's price tag has also been called into question, having set the Blues back £107m after winning the World Cup with Argentina.\n\nMaresca led Leicester City to the Championship title last campaign but he has never managed a match in a top European league. The Italian will need all hands on deck as Chelsea prepare to compete in the Premier League, Carabao Cup, FA Cup, Europa Conference League and Club World Cup next season.\n\nWe use your sign-up to provide content in ways you've consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

I’m not sure what his plan is over the next couple of weeks, if he’ll be back with us or not but it’s exciting to see the talent being dispersed in different squads.\"\n\nAssistant coach Andrew Goodman was also broached on the subject and what message he would have for fans who might question Leinster’s decision to allow him to take the break from 15s when the team is desperate for a trophy.\n\n\"I’m sure those hardcore Leinster fans are also hardcore Irish fans and want to see Ireland do well at the Olympics Games,\" said the New Zealander.\n\n\"We’re all looking forward to seeing him go. He obviously came through that pathway so we’ve got full understanding of why he wants to go and achieve.\n\n\"An Olympic Games, what an amazing experience for someone to tick off, and for Ireland, who have a genuine chance at a medal so it was kind of a once in a lifetime opportunity for Hugo at this stage of his career.\"\n\nListen to the RTÉ Rugby podcast on Apple Podcasts, Spotify or wherever you get your podcasts.\n\n\n\nWatch Munster v Ospreys in the URC on Friday from 7pm on RTÉ2 and RTÉ Player, follow a live blog on rte.ie/sport and the RTÉ News app and listen to commentary on RTÉ Radio 1 Extra. \n\nFollow a live blog of Leinster v Ulster (Saturday 5pm) on rte.ie/sport and the RTÉ News app and listen to updates on RTÉ Radio 1\n\n \n\n\n\n© RTÉ 2025.

This is a chance for me to see if I can be stable in my game.\n\n“Honestly, my physical condition is not the best. I will say my fitness is at 70 to 80 per cent. But all the players are in the same boat.”\n\nThe 26-year-old had to skip last week’s Singapore Open after suffering cramps and hamstring injuries following his efforts in capturing the Thailand Open and finishing runner-up in the Malaysian Masters.\n\nZii Jia, who has moved up to No. 7 in the world ranking, plays China’s world No. 19 Weng Hongyang for a place in the last eight tomorrow.\n\nMeanwhile, another Malaysian representative Leong Jun Hao, who moved up from No. 36 to No. 32 in the rankings, will go up against home favourite and world No. 3 Jonatan Christie in his opening match today.\n\nJun Hao will be making his debut in a Super 1000 competition after he was promoted from the reserves list following several withdrawals.\n\nIn the women’s singles, world No. 33 Goh Jin Wei suffered an early exit after going down 15-21, 17-21 to China’s world No. 6 and Malaysian Masters champion Wang Zhiyi.\n\nThank you for your report!\n\nCopyright © 1995-\n            \n\n Star Media Group Berhad [197101000523 (10894-D)]\n\nBest viewed on Chrome browsers.\n\n\n\nWe would love to keep you posted on the latest promotion.

Djokovic was hurt during a fourth-round victory against No. 23 Francisco Cerundolo on Monday that lasted five sets spread across more than 4 1/2 hours. It was his second consecutive five-setter, with his total time on court across the two exceeding 9 hours.\n\nThe 24-time Grand Slam champion was supposed to face No. 7 seed Casper Ruud, the runner-up each of the past two years at Roland Garros, in the quarterfinals on Wednesday. Instead, Ruud gets a walkover into the semifinals, where he will face No. 4 Alexander Zverev or No. 11 Alex de Minaur.\n\nWith Djokovic, the owner of three French Open titles, gone from the bracket, and Rafael Nadal — owner of a record 14 — eliminated in the first round, someone will be holding the French Open men’s trophy for the first time on Sunday.\n\nThe group of remaining contenders includes No. 2 seed Jannik Sinner, a 22-year-old Italian who defeated No. 10 Grigor Dimitrov 6-2, 6-4, 7-6 (3) on Tuesday to get to the semifinals and now is assured of replacing Djokovic atop the ATP rankings next week.\n\n\n\n\nSinner won the Australian Open in January and becomes the first man from his country to reach No. 1.\n\nHis match against Dimitrov was in progress when news of Djokovic’s withdrawal spread. So Sinner had no idea until he was asked about it during an on-court interview after his win.\n\n“Seeing Novak (injured) is, for everyone, disappointing,” Sinner said, “so I wish him a speedy recovery.”\n\nAnd as for his newfound status?\n\n“It means a lot to me, for sure,” said Sinner, who will renew his exciting rivalry with No. 3 Carlos Alcaraz in Friday’s semifinals.\n\nAlcaraz reached the final four in Paris for the second year in a row — he cramped up and lost to Djokovic in 2023 — by defeating No. 9 Stefanos Tsitsipas 6-3, 7-6 (3), 6-4 on Tuesday night.\n\nSinner and Alcaraz have played eight times, splitting them 4-4. They have played twice at majors, splitting those 1-1.\n\n“Well, it’s a really difficult challenge. I’m not going to lie. Right now, he’s the best player in the world — or the player who is playing the best tennis right now,” Alcaraz said. “It is the match that everybody wants to watch.”\n\nAmid a season in which Djokovic is only 18-6 and has not reached a final at any tournament, let alone won one, he needed to get back to the title match at the French Open to continue to add to his record for most weeks at No. 1.\n\nFor years and years, Djokovic, Nadal and Roger Federer ruled men’s tennis as the so-called Big Three, accumulating a total of 66 major championships among them. But Federer, now 42, is retired, and Nadal, who turned 38 on Monday, is trying to figure out how much longer he can compete after missing most of the past 1 1/2 seasons with injuries.\n\nNo one knows yet how long Djokovic, 37, will be sidelined or what, if any, effect this might have on his future.\n\nWimbledon, where has won seven titles, starts July 1, and the tennis competition at the Paris Olympics starts at Roland Garros on July 27.\n\n“I saw that he was obviously physically struggling (Monday), and I honestly thought ... he was on the verge of losing,” said U.S. Open champion Coco Gauff, who made her way into the women’s semifinals with a three-set win over Ons Jabeur and will play No. 1 Iga Swiatek on Thursday.\n\nSeeing Djokovic pull out the win against Cerundolo, Gauff said, made her think “that he would win the title.”\n\nDjokovic’s knee had been bothering him for a couple of weeks before he arrived in Paris for the French Open — something he kept to himself until after the win against Cerundolo. Early in the second set Monday, Djokovic tweaked his knee and took a medical timeout. A trainer worked on the joint then and during subsequent changeovers, and Djokovic took what he said a tournament doctor told him was the maximum dose of pills allowed to dull the pain and reduce any inflammation.\n\n“I don’t know what will happen tomorrow — or, after tomorrow, if I’ll be able to step out on the court and play,” Djokovic said Monday evening.\n\nDjokovic trailed by two sets to one, and was down a break at 4-2 in the fourth, against Cerundolo before raising his level of play once the medication kicked in.\n\n“I was,” Djokovic said afterward, “maybe three or four points away from losing this match.”\n\nYes, he stuck it out, and, yes, he came back to win — it was his 370th victory in Grand Slam play, breaking a tie with Federer for the most in tennis history — but it was costly. And Djokovic said Monday he thought it could have been prevented if the clay inside Court Philippe Chatrier had been cared for better.\n\nBoth in that match — and during his 4 1/2-hour victory in the third round, which ended after 3 a.m. Sunday — Djokovic tried to get the chair umpires to have the court swept more frequently to improve traction.\n\n“I mean, today I injured myself. Yes, I survived. I won the match. Great. But will I be able to play next one?” he said, tapping his palms on a table for emphasis.\n\n___\n\nAP tennis: https://apnews.com/hub/tennis\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCopyright 2025 The Associated Press.

        "expanded content": "The nature of the injury that has forced Novak Djokovic to withdraw from the 2024 French Open raises concerns that the Serbian’s season could be derailed at a crucial juncture. \n\nIt was announced on Tuesday that Djokovic had pulled out of Roland Garros due to a “medial meniscus tear” in his right knee.\n\nThe tennis great, who will lose the world No 1 ranking to Jannik Sinner as a result of his withdrawal, was due to face Casper Ruud in the quarter-finals in Paris on Wednesday.\n\nDjokovic appeared to sustain the injury after slipping on the clay during the second set of his marathon five-set fourth round victory against Francisco Cerundolo on Monday. He received treatment and took painkillers, which — he revealed afterwards — took effect in the latter stages of the match.\n\nThe 37-year-old looked hampered for much of the second, third and fourth sets, before remarkably raising his level to prevail 6-1, 5-7, 3-6, 7-5, 6-3 after four hours and 39 minutes. It is unclear whether playing through the injury could have worsened it.\n\nTop 7 most men’s Grand Slam quarter-finals reached as Novak Djokovic breaks Roger Federer record\n\nIt was Djokovic’s second consecutive five-set victory after he overcame Lorenzo Musetti in a third round contest that, ridiculously, finished at 3:07am on Sunday morning — the latest finish in French Open history. He spent over nine hours on court across the two matches.\n\nThe injury blow is a brutally cruel way for Djokovic to be denied the chance to win his fourth Roland Garros crown and 25th Grand Slam title, particularly given his herculean efforts to reach the last eight.\n\nMeniscus tears vary in severity and a timeframe is yet to be disclosed for Djokovic’s recovery. In some cases, it is an injury that can rule athletes out for months.\n\nA reason for optimism is the fact Taylor Fritz sustained a torn meniscus injury in his right knee at Roland Garros in 2021 and recovered in time to play Wimbledon after undergoing surgery.\n\nIt is worrying, though, that Djokovic has suffered the injury in such a critical period of the year, with three huge tournaments all on the horizon.\n\nThe 2024 Wimbledon Championships will begin on July 1, giving Djokovic less than a month to recover. Wimbledon would arguably represent Djokovic’s best opportunity to win a Major this year given his grass-court prowess and dominance at the All England Club in the last decade.\n\nFollowing this, the tennis event at the 2024 Paris Olympics, which will be played at Stade Roland Garros, will run from July 27 to August 4. The Serbian has highlighted this year’s Olympics as a huge priority.\n\nGiven Djokovic is 37, it could be his last real opportunity to win an Olympic gold medal, which is the only significant prize he has not claimed in his unparalleled career.\n\nA packed summer schedule of big tournaments will then conclude with the year’s fourth and final Grand Slam, the US Open, which will be held from August 26 to September 8. Djokovic is the defending champion at Flushing Meadows.\n\nDjokovic announced the unfortunate news in a post on his Instagram account: “I am really sad to announce that I have to withdraw from Roland Garros.\n\n \n\n \n\nA post shared by Novak Djokovic (@djokernole)\n\n\n\n“I played with my heart and gave my all in yesterday’s match and unfortunately, due to a medial meniscus tear in my right knee, my team and I had to make a tough decision after careful consideration and consultation.\n\n“I wish the best of luck to the players competing this week and sincerely thank the incredible fans for all of the love and continued support. See you soon. With love and gratitude, Nole.”\n\nThe 15 countries to produce ATP world No 1 singles players: Italy joins list after Jannik Sinner’s rise\n\n\n                \"I was thinking about my end of the road as well when we were watching Rafa having his speech.\"            \n\n\n                Francisco Cerundolo suffered a shock opening round loss that could be significant.             \n\n\n                Fritz is guaranteed to slip down the ATP Rankings after a shock French Open exit.            \n\n\n                Chris Evert has given a brutal assessment of Novak Djokovic's French Open chances.            \n\n© Planet Sport Limited 2025 • All Rights Reserved"

Wishing Novak a speedy recovery.\"\n\nThe Serbian star claims he “screwed up” his right knee slipping and sliding on Court Philippe-Chatrier during his last-16 win over Francisco Cerundolo on Monday.\n\nDjokovic took painkillers and needed a medical time-out during the second set but played through the pain barrier to fight from 2-1 down to secure his five-set comeback victory over the Argentine - a record-breaking 370th Grand Slam singles win.\n\nThat win came after he finished at a ridiculous 3.06am in the early hours of Sunday morning, again battling back to beat Lorenzo Musetti in five gruelling sets. \n\nBEST FREE BET SIGN UP OFFERS FOR UK BOOKMAKERS\n\nAnd the exit of arguably the biggest name in tennis will come as a major blow to French Open chiefs but they only have themselves to blame for this episode.\n\nDjokovic blasted officials for refusing to sweep the court more regularly than the customary brush at the end of each set.\n\nHe asked: \"Why is it such a big issue to sweep the court every second changeover?\"\n\nCourt supervisor Wayne McKewen responded: \"Because it’s the groundspeople that make that decision.\"\n\nThen Djokovic replied: \"Who is playing tennis? Explain it to me. I screwed up my knee because I made a quick move. I’m sliding and slipping all the time.\n\n\"The only thing I’m asking is, every second changeover, you sweep the court. That’s all. What is the problem with the groundspeople doing it every second changeover? For them.\n\n\"You’re the supervisor, you are representing us players. I’m telling you, as a player, it’s not okay! \n\n\"You’re going to go with the groundspeople that do not play tennis. But they know better than me if the court is good or not?\"\n\nMinutes after his request was denied, Djokovic suffered his injury as he skidded on the clay. \n\nDjokovic then took a tumble early in the decisive fifth set and sarcastically said \"well done\" for making the court so slippery and \"not dangerous\". \n\nThe 2016, 2021 and 2023 French Open king added in his press conference: “I don’t know what exactly they have done. It seems like some of the clay was removed, so there was very little, almost no clay on the court.\n\n“Because of the drier conditions and sun and warmer conditions, it affects the clay in such a way that it becomes very slippery.\n\n“So the injury that I had today with the knee happened exactly because of that, because I slipped, and I slide a lot. Everyone slides on clay, but I slipped way too many times. That is quite unusual.\n\n“Of course I do, because I have an aggressive kind of movement, dynamic change of directions.\n\nThis was just too many times\n\n“It’s normal for me, I’ve slipped and fell on the clay many times in my life, and on grass as well, but this was just too many times.”\n\nRafael Nadal, the 14-time Roland Garros winner, was dumped out in round one by Alexander Zverev, whose trial over domestic abuse allegations began in Germany during the tournament. \n\nHowever, Djokovic's withdrawal guarantees a new winner in the men's singles in the French Open and the first final since 2004 without one of Djokovic, Nadal or Roger Federer involved.\n\nReigning major winners Carlos Alcaraz and Jannik Sinner are both in the bottom half of the draw and will be hopeful of adding to their tallies.\n\nSinner beat Grigor Dimitrov in straight sets to reach the semis while Alcaraz faces Stefanos Tsitsipas in his quarter-final tonight.\n\nIn Djokovic's half, Ruud wants to go one better than his final defeats in 2022 and 2023 - losing both in straight sets.\n\nZverev has reached three consecutive semis in Paris and knows victory over De Minaur will see him take on Ruud - a far less daunting prospect than Serbian winning machine Djokovic. \n\nAlso, 22-year-old Sinner will become the new world No1 for the first time on Monday when the rankings are updated, the first Italian to claim top spot.\n\nDjokovic has less than four weeks to get ready for the first round of Wimbledon where he has been a seven-time winner.\n\nWhat is a more plausible scenario is that he skips the grass swing and focuses fully on the Olympics, which are held at Roland Garros, where he desperately wants that singles gold medal.\n\nFormer Wimbledon champ and Djokovic's ex-coach Boris Becker told Eurosport: “It’s a serious injury and it won’t go away tomorrow.\n\n\n\n“That leaves me a bit speechless. You need your knees on grass, you really do slip all the time.\n\n“A torn medial meniscus is a serious injury and the question naturally arises as to whether surgery is necessary.”\n\n©News Group Newspapers Limited in England No. 679215 Registered office: 1 London Bridge Street, London, SE1 9GF. \"The Sun\", \"Sun\", \"Sun Online\" are registered trademarks or trade names of News Group Newspapers Limited.

It’s hard to focus on both, peaking in June and then late August.\n\nStill, there’s no doubt there’s opportunities for Irish athletes to get on the podium.\n\nRome will be a reduced timetable, down from 10 days to five in an effort to make it appealing to the global stars in an Olympic year.\n\nSome big names have still decided to bypass the Europeans. In the women’s 1500m for example, Laura Muir, has opted to concentrate on training, and this will only boost Ciara Mageean’s prospects.\n\nHaving led home Sarah Healy in an Irish one-two in Ostrava recently, the Portaferry woman joked that gold is the only colour medal she doesn’t have at the Europeans.\n\nShe will know this is an opportunity to get top of the podium.\n\nRhasidat Adeleke will also spearhead Irish medal prospects.\n\n\n\nPeople were wondering if she would compete in the Europeans, possibly keeping her powder dry for Olympics. She even hinted that 200m might be her event for Rome, from an energy conservation point of view with Paris looming, but she has plumped for the 400m.\n\nRhasidat hasn’t raced at this distance yet this season, but looked good at 100m recently, while her 200m times were at world-class level.\n\nIt bodes well, plus her relay split times from the World Relays in the Bahamas where Ireland secured bronze mean that she looks in great shape, but she will have stiff competition.\n\nShe is currently ranked outside the top three - Poland's Natalia Kaczmarek, followed by Femke Bol and Kieke Klaver of Netherlands leading the way - but on her day, she can definitely medal, if not take gold.\n\nRhasidat will again be in relay action, and for the first time at the Europeans, we will have Irish representation in all three events; men’s 4x100m, women’s and mixed 4x400m.\n\nLooking at the men's relay team, Sean Doggett, who won the Irish Schools last weekend, is included and it’s a great opportunity for him and highlights the role relays are playing in developing talent and creating depth\n\nThe women's 4x400m team is very strong and has the credentials to be right up there in the hunt for silverware.\n\nRhasidat is available and Sharlene Mawdsley is in serious form. Ranked fourth in her individual event, her confidence is sky high.\n\nSophie Becker is performing really well at the moment and ranked 12th for the 400m individually, just outside Olympic qualification time.\n\nThere is a real growing interest in the relay teams, following success in reaching World and European finals, as well as such a strong showing in the Bahamas where the women and mixed teams sealed their place in Paris in some style.\n\nThere will be extra focus on the mixed relay team, who will be competing early in the programme, and with top-12 ranked athletes in each sprint event obtaining a bye to the semi-finals, it shouldn't have a major impact on the individual competitions.\n\nIt’s a fantastic opportunity for this team to build on the brilliant bronze from the World Athletics Relays won back in May.\n\nIt’s a fantastic opportunity for them, and the fact you have a world-class athlete available in Rhasidat, who is splitting 48 seconds, helps takes us to another level.\n\nWe have others more than capable of making finals.\n\nThe 100m hurdles is a strong European event, but Sarah Lavin, who will have a bye to the semi-finals, is a serial finalist at major championships. She will have her sights on getting to the final and giving it a real rattle.\n\nMark English is another athlete coming into form. When you look at the 800m rankings, he’s not a million mile away and has pedigree at the Europeans to make a final.\n\nTom Barr is chipping away and getting quicker. He’s coming into shape at the right time and competes well at championships.\n\nIn the men's 1500m, you have Andrew Coscoran, who is running at a really good level right now. His season is progressing nicely and he is an athlete who loves the buzz of a championship.\n\nLuke McCann has decided to sit it out to concentrate on qualification. Nick Griggs is a young athlete with immense talent. There is no pressure on him coming into the senior environment and he could thrive in the Italian capital.\n\nThe interesting thing about the athletic year is that it’s not one size fits all.\n\nSome athletes have banked their qualifier times very early and have planned accordingly. Others had to go out in early May, straight off the bat, to run qualifiers for Rome.\n\nThat can be difficult. Athletes can be chasing times and performances, sometimes they get to major champions and are exhausted. That’s hard, and I have been in that position myself, trying to balance both physical and mental preparation.\n\nSome of the Irish athletes may not be at their optimal performance level just yet due to Olympics on the horizon, but what is guaranteed is that, as competitors, they will be keen to get the confidence up and lay down solid foundations in Rome.\n\nWatch the European Athletics Championships from Friday to Wednesday with coverage on RTÉ2 and RTÉ2 Player\n\n© RTÉ 2025.

        "expanded content": "Manchester United have earmarked the end of the year for the Old Trafford task force to conclude their findings.\n\nIt was announced in March that a task force to regenerate Old Trafford and the land around it had been created, and that it would be chaired by Lord Sebastian Coe.\n\nFormer United captain Gary Neville was appointed to the panel, along with Manchester Mayor Burnham and Sara Todd, chief executive of Trafford Council. The panel was created to explore all options but to closely examine the feasibility of a new building and wider regeneration.\n\nInitially, an external source indicated the task force could conclude their findings at the end of the summer but that timeframe has been corrected by club sources.\n\nALSO READ: The eight wonderkids who could save United millions\n\nALSO READ: Southgate changes tune on United defender Luke Shaw\n\nIt's understood the Old Trafford task force is expected to announce its findings toward the end of 2024 and once that is concluded, the next steps of the project can begin. The task force panel, which has 14 members, is aiming to hold at least one meeting per month.\n\nOnce the best course of action, whether to revamp or rebuild, is decided and the implications for the regeneration project are considered, there will be movement.\n\nSir Jim Ratcliffe has said it's his preference to build a new Old Trafford, to create a 'Wembley of the north' and a 'stadium that's befitting the club and the brand'. Estimated costs for that have been put at £2billion.\n\nNeville, speaking on the club's official Utd Podcast, claimed he would not oppose an entirely new stadium being built. \"I’m not one of those that says that because I've watched football out there for 45 years that I need to watch the exact same players on that exact blade of grass,\" he said.\n\nWhich architectural firm is given the contract to redevelop or rebuild Old Trafford is yet to be decided. American-founded company Populous were retained to explore the feasibility options for Old Trafford but that doesn't mean they will be the architects used to advance the plans.\n\nPopulous are responsible for Tottenham Hotspur Stadium, The Emirates and the Principality in Cardiff, which was the first stadium in the UK with a fully retractable roof. They are the leading architectural firm for such redevelopments and it's understood they are 'hopeful' of being trusted by Sir Jim Ratcliffe to design the future of Old Trafford.\n\nTottenham's stadium is the best-in-class in the Premier League and cost around £1billion to build. It is the first purpose-built NFL venue outside of the US and Spurs have a deal to host a minimum of two games per year over 10 years, which is an extra revenue stream.\n\nNeville added: “What I am absolutely certain of is that we need to have a stadium that is up there with some of the other great stadiums in Europe and in this country at this moment in time, Tottenham is the benchmark. It's a stunning stadium, brand new, and we need to get to that level.\"\n\nThe Old Trafford task force held its first meeting in April. Manchester Major Burnham was asked by the Manchester Evening News what happened and said: \"It was an introductory meeting. We were all getting to know each other, although most of us knew each other already, but just scoping out what we could do.\n\n\"Obviously our role is to facilitate the club's decision. We're there to help with the information, evidence, perspective, sometimes adding broader perspective that sometimes the club aren't aware of.\n\n\"So it was very high-level introductory, but it was really good that Lord Coe was there. I think that's a really big statement of not just the club's ambition but Greater Manchester's ambition to have someone of his stature [involved] who delivered the London Olympics.\n\n\"And I think that sends a message that this is more than building a stadium, which is a really important message to get over. This is potentially one of the biggest regeneration projects that the north of England will see in this century actually, it's that significant.\"\n\nThe 14 members of the Old Trafford task force:\n\nAt Reach and across our entities we and our partners use information collected through cookies and other identifiers from your device to improve experience on our site, analyse how it is used and to show personalised advertising.

Unfortunately, we are increasingly encountering this. But it has nothing to do with reality, it is absolute slander and nothing more,\" Peskov told reporters.\n\nRussia has frequently lambasted the Olympic Games after Russian and Belarusian athletes were banned from participating in the competition under the Russian or Belarusian flags due to the ongoing war in Ukraine.\n\nThey are able to compete as \"neutral\" competitors, however. The IOC has said that athletes who actively support the war, or who are contracted to the Russian or Belarusian military or national security agencies, cannot compete.\n\nAlready at a low ebb after Russia's invasion of Ukraine, Russia's relations with France have deteriorated further in recent months after French President Emmanuel Macron suggested that Paris would consider sending ground troops to Ukraine if such a request was made.\n\nThe comments sent NATO's leadership and other members of the military alliance scrambling to deny that there were any plans to send ground troops into Ukraine, a move that would put Russia and NATO in direct conflict.\n\nRussia's pro-Kremlin media wasted no time in lambasting Macron for his comments, and relishing the discomfort they caused for Western allies, and have frequently warned that French troops would be targeted if deployed in Ukraine.\n\nRussia has meanwhile positioned itself as the victim of \"Russophobia\" by the West. On Tuesday, the Russian Embassy in Paris demanded that the French authorities stop what it claimed was a misinformation campaign directed against Russia.\n\n\"The embassy appeals to the French authorities to put an end to the unprovoked and unsubstantiated anti-Russian information campaign,\" a communiqué issued by the Russian Embassy on social media platform X said.\n\n\"The Russian Embassy in France expresses its strong protest against a new Russophobic campaign launched in the French media. The hysteria unleashed is already directly affecting the security of Russian citizens in France, including Embassy staff,\" the embassy claimed, without giving further details.\n\nFrance has not yet responded on the comments.\n\nDisclosure: CNBC's parent company NBCUniversal owns NBC Sports and NBC Olympics.

The video, which has been circulating since the fall of 2023, is falsely presented as a “Netflix” documentary.\n\nAccording to MTAC the video was the work of the pro-Russian Storm-1679 propaganda group. The video is one of a growing number of Russian bots running a campaign now to disparage the Olympics, France, the host country, and President Emmanuel Macron in revenge for the IOC banning Russian athletes from competing under the country’s flag and France’s leadership.\n\nOne of the approaches used by the Kremlin-affiliated groups to dissuade people from attending the games is spreading misinformation surrounding the threat of violence. MTAC says the propaganda offensive is likely to intensify ahead of the July Games – already versions of the documentary have been published in several languages using “generative artificial intelligence” that generates new data streams to extend the video’s contact reach.\n\nAnother group impersonated the France24 media outlet with false reports that almost a quarter of those who had bought tickets for Olympic events had requested refunds because of concerns about possible terror attacks, capitalizing on the fears that still exist from the November 2015 attacks on Stade France and the Bataclan theatre that killed 130 and several ISIS-inspired knife attacks in 2023.\n\nThe pro-Russian doppelganger groups have also been posing as German media outlets attempting to inflame anti-immigration sentiment in the country, and undermine support for Ukraine as well as posing as news sites warning of potential violence aimed at the Olympics.\n\nRussian-based hackers were implicated in attacks against the World Anti-Doping Agency, in 2016 and the 2018 Winter Olympics in South Korea.\n\nThe IOC, Paris 2024 organizers and the Kremlin have yet to respond to media requests for comment on these latest incidents.\n\nKyiv Post is Ukraine’s first and oldest English news organization since 1995. Its international market reach of 97% outside of Ukraine makes it truly Ukraine’s Global – and most reliable – Voice.\n\nMenu\n\nMultimedia\n\nAbout\n\nPolicies\n\n\n                            Web links to Kyiv Post material are allowed provided that they contain a hyperlink to the\n                            stories and only a brief extract (not more than 10 percent) of the text.\n                        \n\nOnline media registration number: R40-05383\n\n© 1995-2025 BISNESGROUPP LLC\n\n\n                    All materials, including photographs, contained on this site are protected by copyright law and\n                    may\n                    not be reproduced without the prior written permission of BIZNESGRUPP TOV at [email protected].\n                    All Interfax-Ukraine news agency stories cannot be reproduced or distributed in any form without\n                    written permission of Interfax-Ukraine.\n                "

Russia has been banned from the 2024 Olympics, although a small number of Russian athletes may compete as neutrals.\n\nThe fake Cruise video, which appeared on the Telegram messaging platform last year, is called Olympics Has Fallen and uses artificial intelligence-generated audio of the film star’s voice to present a “strange, meandering script” disparaging the IOC. The documentary, whose title riffs on the Gerard Butler action film Olympus Has Fallen, also claims falsely to have been produced by Netflix and is promoted with bogus five-star reviews from the New York Times and the BBC.\n\n“The video … clearly signalled the content’s creators committed considerable time to the project and demonstrated more skill than most influence campaigns we observe,” said Microsoft’s threat analysis center, in a report published on Monday.\n\nThe video was made by a Kremlin-linked group called Storm-1679, which has in the past deceived US actors including Elijah Wood into recording messages on Cameo, a website where people can pay celebrities for personalised video messages, which were then turned into anti-Ukrainian propaganda.\n\nStorm-1679’s Olympics campaign over the past year includes a collection of videos spreading fears of violence during the games, which run from 26 July to 11 August. The group has published spoof broadcast news reports that Parisians are buying property insurance in anticipation of terror attacks and that a quarter of tickets have been returned due to terror fears. Both clips impersonated well-known broadcasters Euro News and France24.\n\nSocial media accounts linked to Storm-1679 have shown images claiming to represent graffiti in Paris threatening violence to Israelis attending the games. Several of the images also referenced the attacks at the 1972 Munich Olympics by Palestinian terrorists in which 11 members of the Israeli Olympics team died.\n\n“Microsoft did not observe any independent confirmation that the graffiti physically exists, suggesting the images were likely digitally generated,” said the report.\n\nRussia has a long tradition of seeking to undercut the games, said the tech firm, including when the Soviet Union boycotted the 1984 event in Los Angeles and distributed divisive leaflets to Olympic committees in countries including Zimbabwe, Sri Lanka and South Korea.\n\nAnother Russian group, known as Storm-1099 or “Doppelganger”, has set up fake French-language news sites making claims of corruption at the IOC and potential violence in Paris. Mock versions of the Le Parisien and Le Point outlets also present Macron as a political figure indifferent to the hardship faced by French citizens.\n\nMicrosoft said it expected Russian efforts to expand to other languages and attempt to flood social media via automated accounts, while the use of generative AI – systems that produce highly convincing text, video, image and audio – is also likely to increase.\n\nLast month, Microsoft issued a report documenting similar Chinese attempts to interfere in elections in South Korea, India and the US using AI-generated material to deliver false information. The country’s propaganda apparatus often uses fake news anchors to purvey disinformation."

Hundreds of nations are set to send their best athletes in the hopes of bringing home gold medals.\n\nOne country that will not be participating is Russia. The IOC banned Russia in October 2023 due to its ongoing occupation of Ukraine. Russian athletes who qualified before the ban will still be eligible to participate as “individual neutral athletes” instead of under the Russian flag.\n\nAccording to a new report, Russia has spent the time since this ruling attempting to discredit the 2024 Olympics and strike fear into potential participants and fans who will make the trip to Paris.\n\nThe report, compiled by Microsoft’s threat intelligence unit, tracks “prolific Russian influence actors” that began focusing on disparaging the 2024 Olympic Games, including by posting a bogus documentary featuring an AI deepfake of Tom Cruise last summer, according to NBC News.\n\nThe Russians have two central objectives, the report states. Those objectives are “to denigrate the reputation of the International Olympic Committee on the world stage and to create the expectation of violence breaking out in Paris during the 2024 Summer Olympic Games.”\n\nThe AI-generated “Olympics Has Fallen” documentary is another focal point of the report, as it featured a deepfake of Cruise and fake reviews from the New York Times and Washington Post. The documentary was pulled from YouTube at the International Olympic Committee’s request. Additionally, there were reports of AI-generated news broadcasts stoking fears of terrorism.\n\nMicrosoft also noted in the report that “If they cannot participate in or win the Games, then they seek to undercut, defame, and degrade the international competition in the minds of participants, spectators, and global audiences. The Soviet Union boycotted the 1984 Summer Games held in Los Angeles and sought to influence other countries to do the same.”\n\n[NBC News]\n\n\"What are you trying to start here?\"\n\n\"Seems a little warm, for, uh...yeah.\"\n\nAll four team names would be very familiar to USFL fans...\n\nJemele Hill criticizes Disney CEO Bob Iger for reportedly pressuring The View to tone down anti-Trump rhetoric.\n\n\"It’s a bit on the nose.\"\n\n\"I don't need lectures from others about 'good of the game.'\"\n\n\"What are you trying to start here?\"\n\n\"Seems a little warm, for, uh...yeah.\"\n\nAll four team names would be very familiar to USFL fans...\n\nJemele Hill criticizes Disney CEO Bob Iger for reportedly pressuring The View to tone down anti-Trump rhetoric.\n\n\"It’s a bit on the nose.\"\n\n\"I don't need lectures from others about 'good of the game.'\""

        "expanded content": "Have you seen clips from a new documentary narrated by Tom Cruise called Olympics Has Fallen, a play on the title of the 2013 movie Olympus Has Fallen? The new film claims to document the corruption in the upcoming Olympic Games in Paris, France. But it’s fake. Cruise’s narration was created with artificial intelligence and the “documentary” is actually the work of disinformation agents tied to the Russian government, according to a new report from researchers at Microsoft.\n\nThe fake documentary is tied to two influence groups in Russia, dubbed Storm-1679 and Storm-1099 by Microsoft, and it’s easy to see how some people could be duped. The film comes in four 9-minute episodes, each starting with Netflix’s signature “ta-dum” sound effect and red-N animation.\n\n“In this series you will discover the inner workings of the global sports industry,” the fake Tom Cruise says as dramatic music plays in the background. “In particular, I will shed some light on the venal executives of the International Olympic Committee, IOC, who are slowly and painfully destroying the Olympic sports that have existed for thousands of years.”\n\nBut there are plenty of signs that this movie is bullshit to anyone  paying attention. For starters, Cruise’s voice is realistic but  sometimes has a stilted delivery. The big giveaway, however, might be  words used by the Russian campaign that wouldn’t be used by Americans.  For example, the first episode includes a line from the fake Cruise narration where he talks about a “hockey match” rather than a hockey game. The word “match” is much more common in Russia for sports like soccer and any real fan of ice hockey in the U.S. would be calling it a game, not a match.\n\nThere are also times when the fake Cruise narration sounds like it’s reading strategy notes made by the people who concocted this piece of disinformation. Much of the documentary spends time trying to tear down the organizers of the Olympics as hopelessly corrupt, and AI-generated Cruise tries to tie it to one of the actor’s most famous roles in the 1990s.\n\n“In Jerry Maguire, my character writes a 25-page-long firm mission statement about dishonesty in the sports management business. Jerry wanted justice for athletes, which makes him extremely relatable,” the narration says.\n\nIt’s hard to imagine a line like that making it into an authentic documentary.\n\nThe fake documentary also has some editing errors that stick out as particularly odd, like when the AI Cruise inexplicably repeats a line, the audio briefly cutting out for no discernible reason. The entire film is available on the messaging app Telegram, where Gizmodo watched it. We’ve uploaded a minute of the film below just to give a sense of how realistic the AI-generated narration sounds.\n\nThe fake documentary first surfaced in June 2023, according to Microsoft, but appears to be getting renewed attention as the Olympics get closer. The games start in Paris on July 26 and are scheduled to last through August 11.\n\nAs Microsoft points out in a report published Sunday, the Storm-1679 group has been trying to instill fear in people about attending the 2024 Olympics in France. Fake videos purporting to show warnings from the CIA claim the games are at risk of a major terrorist attack. And other videos made to look like they’re from reputable news outlets, like France24, “claimed that 24% of tickets for the games had been returned due to fears of terrorism.” That’s simply not true.\n\nMore recently, the disinformation agents have tried to stoke fear around the current war in Gaza, claiming there could be terrorism in France tied to the conflict.\n\n“Storm-1679 has also sought to use the Israel-Hamas conflict to fabricate  threats to the Games,” Microsoft wrote in the new report. “In November 2023, it posted images claiming to  show graffiti in Paris threatening violence against Israeli citizens  attending the Games. Microsoft assesses this graffiti was digitally  generated and unlikely to exist at a physical location.”\n\nThat said, some of the information in the pseudo-documentary is actually true. For example, the film discusses the history of Wu Ching-kuo, the head of amateur boxing’s governing body Aiba, who was suspended for financial mismanagement claims. Other claims about Olympic officials are also true, according to the news sources available online. But that’s to be expected. The most successful propaganda mixes fact and fiction in an effort to make people unsure about what the truth might be.\n\nAll we know for certain is that Tom Cruise never narrated this movie. And if someone is trying to hijack the credibility of a major movie star to spread their message, you should always be skeptical of whatever they have to say—especially as bots help spread that media widely across social media platforms.\n\n“While video has traditionally been a powerful tool for Russian IO  campaigns and will remain so, we are likely to see a tactical shift  towards online bots and automated social media accounts,” Microsoft wrote on Sunday. “These can offer  the illusion of widespread support by quickly flooding social media  channels and give the Russians a level of plausible deniability.”\n\n\r\n          Get the best tech, science, and culture news in your inbox daily.\r\n        \n\n\r\n          News from the future, delivered to your present.\r\n        \n\n\r\n      Please select your desired newsletters and submit your email to upgrade your inbox.\r\n    \n\n\n          'The Final Reckoning' is the last 'Mission: Impossible' film for a while.

I didn’t want her to get in her head.”\n    \n\n\n            Biles then offered her support while Lee competed on bars, high fiving her fellow Olympian shortly after the routine.\n    \n\n\n            “I think she knew that I needed help in the moment,” Lee, who is returning to gymnastics having been diagnosed with kidney disease last year, told reporters.\n    \n\n\n            “She out of anyone understands basically what I did on vault. She just came over to see if I was okay and basically just help boost me up and get my confidence back up because at that point I was kind of thinking that this was over. It was really nice having her in my corner.”\n    \n\n\n            Lee went on to finish fourth at the nationals, her first time competing in the all-around since winning gold at the Tokyo Olympics.\n    \n\n\nRelated gallery\nIn pictures: Superstar gymnast Simone Biles\n\n\n\n            Biles, meanwhile, ended the competition with a combined score of 119.750, finishing ahead of Skye Blakely in second and Kayla DiCello in third.\n    \n\n\n            It was yet another assured performance on her journey to appearing at what would be a third Olympic Games in Paris later this year.\n    \n\n\n            Biles took a break from gymnastics after Tokyo to prioritize her mental health but has seemed full of confidence since returning to the sport, winning four gold medals and a silver at last year’s world championships to become the most decorated gymnast of all time.\n    \n\n\n            She was victorious at the Core Hydration Classic last month and, after following that up with another impressive display at the national championships, will now look to secure her spot on the team for Paris at the Olympic Trials.\n    \n\n\n            “I use the phrase ageing like fine wine,” Biles said about her recent form. “It’s just getting better and better so we’ll see, hopefully we get to ride this out for the rest of the year – pretty excited about that.”\n    \n\n\n            Asked about how she deals with mounting expectations on her performances, Biles explained that she tries to focus on her physical and mental health, attending therapy sessions once a week.\n    \n\n\n            “I think at this point, mentally is just as important as I physically feel,” she said, adding, “That was the hardest part after Tokyo – I didn’t trust myself to do gymnastics.\n    \n\n\n            “I knew that it would come if I started training again but it was really hard to trust myself.

Please try again later.\n\nThis was published 11 months ago\n\nAdd articles to your saved list and come back to them any time.\n\nWhen Football Australia representatives reached out to the legend that is Evonne Goolagong Cawley, they just hoped she might agree to be involved in a surprise presentation to honour Lydia Williams. As it turns out, Evonne is a massive Matildas fan.\n\nAustralia’s OG First Nations sporting icon had followed the national team throughout the beautiful mania that was 2023, and had been hoping to get to a game. Within hours, the governing body had booked her a flight to Sydney so she could attend Monday night’s second friendly against China.\n\nAnd really, the actual football was the supporting act to the lead role playing what might well be Williams’ final outing for a side she has spent 19 years moulding into her image that will endure long after she officially bids farewell following the Paris Olympics.\n\nIt started in the warm-up, when her teammates ran out at Accor Stadium wearing ‘Thank you Lyds’ shirts, and continued as the teams lined up for the Welcome to Country and national anthems, when Goolagong Cawley appeared out of nowhere and wrapped a Booka around Williams’ shoulders.\n\nMade from the skins of four kangaroos – Williams’s totem – this Booka features panels depicting her childhood in Katanning, Western Australia and her international career, along with crow footprints and river rocks symbolising her late father Ron Williams, one of Australia’s most respected Aboriginal elders. Overall, the animal skin cloak represents all that is important to the 36-year-old.\n\nEvonne Goolagong Cawley presents Lydia Williams with her Booka pre-match.Credit: Getty\n\nFA had it made by artist Lea Taylor, a Bibbulmun (Noongar) yorga who has a connection to the Williams family, following detailed secret discussions with the goalkeeper’s mother Diana. Preparing the skins for the Booka is said to be women’s business. On the pitch it was a gift from a Wiradjuri woman to a Noongar woman, as Goolagong Cawley hugged Williams. For the latter, “was probably the moment that tipped me over emotion wise”.\n\n“I don’t know if it was game recognising game,” Williams said to laughs. “No, but it was a lovely moment. I think a lot of sporting women in Australia just want to leave the game better than when they first arrived in it, and don’t really probably realise the impact of how they have shaped the culture of not only women’s sport but just Australian sport.\n\n“To receive that from such an icon - a legend of tennis - is just absolutely, really humbling. An Indigenous woman that’s represented the country and her culture and done so much.”\n\nWilliams shares a moment with Mackenzie Arnold.Credit: Getty\n\nBehind them was the Cathy Freeman stand. It was, as Williams had observed the day before, “a closing of the circle”. The starting XI left their spot in the line to stand with her as a tribute video played, and then she took her place in the Matildas’ goal for the 104th time.\n\nIt felt fitting that Williams started this match, and that she wore the captain’s armband. Equally so that she was involved within the first minute - even if only because of an early Chinese attack. Her every touch of the ball thereafter - in the end she was rarely needed - engendered a cheer from the 76,798 in attendance. It is the largest crowd the Matildas have played in front of to date - more than the maximum 75,784 able to be squeezed into this venue during last year’s World Cup.\n\nThat felt fitting, too. Officially, this 2-0 win was an Olympics farewell game. A chance for Australia to watch the Matildas play one last time before they head to Paris, and a chance for coach Tony Gustavsson to get one last look at his players before naming his 18-player squad on Tuesday morning.\n\nAs it turned out, the players had already been told whether they were in or out before they’d even made it to the stadium, which made the unofficial elements more significant still. Gustavsson subbed Williams off just before half-time, to round applause from all quarters and hugs from teammates. She saved the biggest for Mackenzie Arnold - her literal and figurative replacement, on the touchline tonight and as Australia’s first-choice goalkeeper into the future.\n\nThe rest was as Gustavsson had promised: more energised, aggressive and dynamic than Friday’s 1-1 draw with China at Adelaide Oval. As expected, Caitlin Foord was rested as precaution following a hamstring-injury scare three days before. And as expected, the other big guns were back. Steph Catley, Ellie Carpenter, Hayley Raso and Kyra Cooney-Cross all started, and Clare Wheeler was introduced in time to score a 48th-minute banger from a header off a free-kick.\n\nThat opened the scoring, and Raso doubled the lead in the 56th. But it was Cortnee Vine’s assist that stole the limelight - a through ball of beauty to rival them all. Gustavsson’s selection decisions here alone suggest both Wheeler and Vine appear likely to be on the plane to the Olympics.\n\nVine’s positioning, in particular, felt like a clue. Gustavsson deployed the winger out of position as a striker, suggesting he is testing out a back-up plan for Michelle Heyman - his only available centre-forward for the tournament due to a glut of injuries including that of Sam Kerr.\n\n“Yeah, and also two very different player types with Michelle being more of a back-to-goal nine and a strong aerial presence in the box, and Vine being more of a runner in behind with pace,” Gustavsson said.\n\n“And with the amount of wide options that we have now with [Kaitlyn] Torpey playing wide in a good way as well, like she did against Uzbekistan and coming in today. Mary can play wide on both sides. Caitlin [Foord] can play wide. We have a lot of wide options … but we have a little bit lack of depth in the nine position.”\n\nThe Matildas celebrate Hayley Raso’s second-half goal in front of a record crowd.Credit: Getty\n\nNews, results and expert analysis from the weekend of sport sent every Monday.

He is back in attacking mode,” said Yoke Meng, who was part of the Thomas Cup winning team in 1992.\n\n“Before this, he tried to work on his weaknesses but he forgot about his main strength which is his attacking.\n\n“He wanted to improve his defense and net play but everything needs to be done together.\n\n“Now, he realises this and this is a very good sign as he has been winning,” added Yoke Meng.\n\nThe 58-year-old was Zii Jia’s coach from 2015 to 2016 when the latter was a junior player in the Badminton Association of Malaysia (BAM).\n\nYoke Meng believes that his former charge is a medal prospect in the Olympics along with world No. 5 men’s doubles pair Aaron Chia-Soh Wooi Yik.\n\n“He is one of our medal prospects along with our men’s doubles pair. To be successful at the OIympics, they have to peak at the right time and avoid injuries,” said Yoke Meng.\n\n“Mentally, they must also be at their best.

It's also outlined that the Old Trafford management team are not expected to change their mind, even in spite of Garnacho's desire to take part.\n\nThe Olympics finish on August 9 - just one week before the start of the 2024/25 Premier League campaign. And given clubs have no obligation to release players for the games, Argentina boss Javier Mascherano could see more players blocked from competing.\n\nWhile the report claims that Garnacho expressed his desire to compete in the games to Ten Hag, it still remains to be seen whether the Dutchman will actually be in charge at Old Trafford next season.\n\nJoin the debate! Should Man Utd let Garnacho play in the Olympics? Let us know here.\n\nThe former Ajax chief, 54, oversaw the club's worst ever Premier League campaign.

Just 22, her haul of 69 tries this season was the second-best total in series history, behind only Vilimoni Delasau’s 83 for Fiji in the inaugural 1999-2000 season.\n\nAustralia celebrate their triumph in Madrid.Credit: Getty\n\nArguably Levi’s biggest moment came in the semi-final against New Zealand. The clock was in the red and Australia trailed 19-14 when Levi gathered a restart and ended up scoring the tying try. Tia Hinds then nailed a clutch conversion to win the game 21-19.\n\nWalsh paid tribute to Levi’s standout performance in Spain and believes there is no limit to where her talents can take her in rugby.\n\n“Maddison can rewrite the history books, as long as she has a team supporting her role,” Walsh said.\n\n“She is a freak of a talent with the world at her feet but the space creators around her are just as important.\n\nTia Hinds kicks a clutch conversion against New Zealand.Credit: X\n\n“Within the team we have specific roles and without each performing their role, Maddi cannot be given the opportunity to perform hers.\n\n“She is a very good person above being an athlete, and is willing to get better every tournament. The sky is the limit for her.”\n\nNew Zealand had won the past four tournaments, but they finished 3-3 in matches against Australia this season. The teams also share the event’s two Olympic gold medals and will be the favourites again in Paris.\n\nAustralia captain Charlotte Caslick noted the significance of the semi-final victory.\n\nMaddison Levi charges towards the try line against France.Credit: Getty\n\n“Great to get a win over the Kiwis this morning, we have a ding-dong battle with them,” Caslick said. “Just got confidence out of that and belief in ourselves, which is really important moving into the Paris Games.”\n\nFrance went one better in the men’s series decider, winning their first world title by out-muscling Argentina in the final 19-5 at the same venue, inspired by their star Antoine Dupont.\n\nAustralia lost 24-21 to South Africa in the fifth-place play-off on Sunday, but ran out comfortable 21-0 winners over Great Britain to seal seventh spot.\n\nwith AP\n\nSports news, results and expert commentary.

(AP: Matt Rourke)\n\nMinjee Lee has endured a dramatic collapse to allow Japanese star Yuko Saso to claim US Women's Open glory in Pennsylvania.\n\nAfter starting the final round in a three-way share of the lead, then surging three shots clear, Lee closed with a shocking eight-over 78 as Saso (68) produced a late birdie blitz to romp to a three-stroke triumph at Lancaster Country Club.\n\nSaso finished with a four-under-par total of 276, with compatriot Hinako Shibuno (72) runner-up and completing the first-ever Japanese quinella at a major — men's or women's.\n\nAmericans Andrea Lee (75) and Ally Ewing (66) shared third at even par for the championship.\n\nAfter taking a two-shot lead into the back nine, Lee eventually wound up in a tie for ninth at three over.\n\nThe 27-year-old's hopes of joining Australian golf royalty with a third career major championship essentially perished in a crushing 15-minute stretch mid round.\n\nEven after racking up a third bogey of the day on the ninth, Lee headed to the back nine two shots in front.\n\nBut a sloppy three-putt bogey on the 10th precipitated a shocking meltdown.\n\nMinjee Lee, of Australia, hits out of the sand on the third hole during the final round of the US Women's Open golf tournament at Lancaster Country Club, Sunday, June 2, 2024, in Lancaster, Pa. (AP: Matt Rourke)\n\nLee dunked her tee shot into the water en route to a double-bogey five on the devilish par-3 12th that brought world No.1 Nelly Korda unstuck on Thursday.\n\nWith Saso, playing in the penultimate group behind Lee, posting birdies on 12 and 13, the tournament suddenly turned on a five-shot swing.\n\nFrom two behind, where she started on Sunday, Saso was three in front of Lee and the rest of the chasing pack.\n\nAnother double-bogey from Lee on number 14 ended all hope of the West Australian joining the great Karrie Webb as a dual US Open champion.\n\nABC Sport Daily is your daily sports conversation. We dive into the biggest story of the day and get you up to speed with everything else that's making headlines.\n\nA commanding four-shot winner two years at Pine Needles, Lee now must pick up the pieces from Sunday's wreckage ahead of the season's last three major championships and Paris Olympics all coming in the next two months.\n\nIn stark contrast, Lee's Olympic teammate Hannah Green finished with a flurry to share 16th at five over following a final-round 66, the equal-low round of the week.\n\nBut the spoils — and women's golf's biggest winner's cheque for $US2.4 million ($3.6 million) — belong to Saso, who is nwo a two-time US Open champion.\n\nThe Filipino-born star also won in 2021 at the Olympic Club in San Francisco.\n\nAt 22 years, 11 months and 13 days, Saso is the youngest player in history to win two US Women's Open crowns — and the first ever to land two majors representing different nations.\n\n\"It feels great,\" an emotional Saso said.\n\n\"Winning in 2021 representing the Philippines, I feel like I was able to give back to my mum.\n\n\"And this year I was able to represent Japan and I think I was able to give back to my dad.\n\n\"So I'm very happy that I was able to do it. It's just a wonderful feeling that I was able to give back to my parents.\"\n\nHer latest triumph looked most unlikely after Saso four-putted for double bogey on the sixth to slip four strikes adrift of Lee.\n\nBut then, seemingly in the blink of an eye, everything changed as Lee, striving to join Webb, Jan Stephenson and Peter Thomson as only the fourth Australian to win more than two majors, completely unravelled down the stretch.\n\nCatch up on the action as it unfolded on our blog.\n\nBy Michael Doyle\n\nBy Michael Doyle\n\nIt wasn't to be for Minjee Lee this morning as the Australian fell away on the back nine.\n\nLee finished in the top 10, but will be disappointed with how she finished the tournament.\n\nThat takes nothing away from the champion, Yuka Saso.\n\nFour birdies on the back nine is how everyone should win — let alone a major championship.\n\nYou can get all of your sports news online at ABC Sport.\n\nBye for now.\n\nBy Michael Doyle\n\nMinjee Lee has finished with par on the final hole.\n\nIt was not Lee's day, despite heading into the back nine with a two-shot lead.\n\nLee dropped six shots in six holes, while champion Yuka Saso had four birdies in a five-hole span.\n\nBy Michael Doyle\n\nMinjee will be hoping to finish on a bright note after scoring par on the 17th.\n\nA birdie on the 18th will move her from a tie for nine, to a tie for sixth.\n\nBy Michael Doyle\n\nThere are still a few players to finish, but none of them can catch the clubhouse leader Yuka Saso.\n\nThe Japanese-Filipino star has won her second US Women's Open, finishing the tournament four-under-par.\n\nShe had a stretch of four birdies in five holes on the back nine which won her the title.\n\nBy Michael Doyle\n\nYuka Saso is in the clubhouse at four-under-par.\n\nThe 2021 champion enjoyed four birdies on the back nine.\n\nShe is all but certain to win the tournament.\n\nBy Michael Doyle\n\nIt is a par for Minjee Lee on the driveable Par 4, 16th hole.\n\nMinjee is in a tie for ninth with two holes to play.\n\nA birdie in the final holes can move her into the top-six.\n\nBy Michael Doyle\n\nYuka Saso has shown her first sign of nerves, three-putting the 17th hole to score a bogey.\n\nShe maintains a two-shot lead, but will not be pleased about giving up a stroke on the penultimate hole.\n\nBy Michael Doyle\n\nMinjee Lee has dropped another shot and is now out of contention for the US Women's Open.\n\nShe has scored a bogey on hole 15, and is now eight shots off the lead.\n\nHer playing partner, Andrea Lee, birdied 15 to be three shots back, and with an outside chance of winning.\n\nBy Michael Doyle\n\nYuka Saso is on the cusp of winning a second US Women's Open, and she is doing it the right way.\n\nShe has birdied four of her last five holes.\n\nThe latest came after driving the green on the Par 4 16th hole, followed by a two-putt for the birdie.\n\nBy Michael Doyle\n\nThe 14th hole has continued Minjee Lee's woes.\n\nHer drive went way left, and she had to take an unplayable.\n\nAfter taking relief in thick rough, the ball moved which rules officials needed to decide if Minjee caused that movement.\n\nCurrently, it appears Minjee did not cause the ball to move, which would incur a penalty.\n\nHer shot out of the rough went into a greenside bunker, as her hopes of winning a second US Women's Open rapidly fade.\n\nIt is a double-bogey for Minjee.\n\nBy Michael Doyle\n\nJapanese star Yuka Saso is starting to catch fire.\n\nShe has just birdied the 15th hole, after taking the lead with a birdies at 12 and 13.\n\nSaso, who is the youngest-ever winner of the US Women's Open, could become the youngest to win the major tournament twice.\n\nBy Michael Doyle\n\nMinjee Lee has made par, after a horror 12th hole where she surrendered the lead of the US Women's Open.\n\nLee had a birdie putt that swung from left to right, but unfortunately, it came up short.\n\nThe par keeps Lee in contention with five holes to play.\n\nLee's playing partner, Andrea Lee, made a birdie on 12 and came very close to repeating that feat on 13.\n\nShe in one shot behind the leader, Japan's Yuka Saso.\n\nBy Michael Doyle\n\nMinjee Lee has lost the lead of the US Women's Open, hitting her tee shot at the Par 3 12th into the water.\n\nHer tee shot hit the front of the green and rolled back into the hazard.\n\nLee makes a double-bogey, despite a brilliant effort on her bogey putt.\n\nMeanwhile, former US Women's Open champion Yuka Saso has the outright lead of the tournament with a birdie on hole 13.\n\nBy Michael Doyle\n\nMinjee struggles off the tee has continued, hitting her drive into a fairway bunker.\n\nLee hit her second shot to the front of the green, but it rolled back to the fairway.\n\nA nice chip and putt saved par for Minjee.\n\nBy Michael Doyle\n\nMinjee Lee has picked up her fourth bogey of the day.\n\nShe hit her first fairway of the day on the 10th, but her approach left a long birdie putt.\n\nDespite narrowly missing the birdie, Lee was unable to clean up for par.\n\nHer bogey means she now has a tie for the lead, after Japan's Yuka Saso birdies the 12th hole.\n\nBy Michael Doyle\n\nMinjee Lee is three-under par for the tournament entering the final round.\n\nHer final round partner, US player Andrea Lee, is in a tie for second two shots

All Rights Reserved.\n\nMADRID (AP) — High expectations on the France rugby sevens side for its Paris home Olympics will intensify after it won its first world series title in Madrid on Sunday.\n\nThe men outmuscled Argentina in the final 19-5 after the women were runner-up to Australia 26-7 at Metropolitano Stadium.\n\nSince the world series began in 1999, France had never finished in the top four until last year. This season, it won the Los Angeles leg in March for its first tournament victory in 19 years.\n\nFrance came to the series finale in Madrid ranked fifth but edged Fiji in the semifinals and avenged a pool loss to Argentina.\n\n“The next tournament in Paris will be another story so we’ll take the pleasure now,” France coach Jerome Daret said. “When you’re on top of the wave, you have to be hard on your mindset. I’m very proud of the team, they never gave up, big heart. But it’s not finished. We have a big target in a few weeks and maybe win the Olympics.”\n\nThe Argentines led for almost the entire series and knocked out defending series champion New Zealand to reach the Madrid final unbeaten and have a shot at their first world series title, too.\n\nThey started the final better. Rodrigo Isgro made a try-saving tackle on Jean Pascal Barraque, then Luciano Gonzalez, playing with a heavily taped right ankle, fended off two defenders to score the opening try in the left corner.\n\nBut seconds before halftime, France attacked from behind its own tryline and Varian Pasquet and Barraque worked to set Stephan Parez-Edo Martin free from the halfway line. France led 7-5 at halftime.\n\n\n\n\nWhen Isgro was yellow-carded for a deliberate knockdown in the second half, France used the man advantage to score through Jefferson-Lee Joseph. They clinched the win with a minute to go when Antoine Dupont’s inside pass gave captain Paulin Riva a try.\n\nDupont, the former 15s world player of the year who sacrificed the Six Nations to try for the Olympic sevens squad, has played three tournaments for France and won two golds and a bronze.\n\n“Antoine Dupont is the best player in the world, we think,” Riva said. “When he is on the pitch, we have a lot of confidence.”\n\nThe final finished with an all-in melee. Isgro took exception to Riva’s late clearout and tip-tackled him onto his neck. Isgro, the world sevens player of the year, was red-carded and a sanction may affect his Olympic appearance.\n\nThe France women have never won a tournament and were managing their final to halftime — 7-7 — until Australia cut down the errors. Then it became another Maddison Levi show.\n\nLevi brushed off two defenders for the go-ahead try, finished off the second in the other corner, and face-palmed a defender to score her third.\n\nLevi scored 13 of Australia’s 21 tries in Madrid, including three hat tricks in five games. Her 69 tries in the season were the second best total in series history, among men and women, after Vilimoni Delasau’s 83 for Fiji in the inaugural 1999-2000 season.\n\nArguably her biggest moment was in the semifinal against New Zealand. The clock was in red, Australia trailed 19-14, and Levi regained the restart and ended up scoring the tying try. Then Tia Hinds kicked the conversion from the touchline.\n\nNew Zealand had won the last four tournaments. The battles with Australia finished 3-3 this season. The teams also share the only two Olympic gold medals and will be the favorites again in Paris.\n\nAustralia captain Charlotte Carlick noted its importance after the final.\n\n“Great to get a win over the Kiwis this morning, we have a ding-dong battle with them,” Caslick said. “Just got confidence out of that and belief in ourselves which is really important moving into the Paris Games.”\n\n___\n\nAP rugby: https://apnews.com/hub/rugby\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCopyright 2025 The Associated Press.

Two wins and one defeat over their last three matches for the Indian men’s hockey team. Two steps forward and one step back on their Road to Paris.\n\nIndia’s defeat against GB on Sunday would be frustrating for Craig Fulton for a few reasons. The first of those would be how they were off the pace to start proceedings at the Lee Valley stadium, but the most lasting would be lack of consistency between matches, and even within a match across quarters.\n\nIn essence, the 1-3 defeat against GB was the complete antithesis to India’s 3-0 win against Germany on Saturday. Against GB, India had 8 Penalty Corners and had a 0% conversion rate, while against Germany they won a solitary PC and had a 100% success rate as Harmanpreet Singh scored. Against GB, India struggled to match the intensity of the hosts and didn’t absorb the pressure well while against Germany they withstood serious spells of pressure and defended superbly even when pushed deep. Against GB, India’s forwards apart from Abhishek, were largely ineffective while against Germany, they probably had their best collective game.\n\nLIVE NOW!\n\nHosts Great Britain make an electric start to their #FIHProLeague match versus India.\n\n📱 Stream the match LIVE on https://t.co/fwIh0CvbSd#hockeyequals #hockey #hockeyinvites@gbhockey pic.twitter.com/C9G05DOtQC\n\n— International Hockey Federation (@FIH_Hockey) June 2, 2024\n\nIn what was a fast start to the match from both sides, Nicholas Bandurak struck in the second minute, seconds after India had a circle entry of their own. GB’s pace of counterattack left India playing catch up and it got worse when they conceded another 10 minutes later. This time a quick one-touch passing move sliced India open and Bandurak’s powerful shot was too good for PR Sreejesh.\n\nFighting back from 0-2 was never going to be easy. “We didn’t start too well, they had a good spell of pressure. We have created some half chances, but haven’t taken them yet. It’s tight.  This game will be decided by the next goal, hopefully we can get it,” said Fulton at half time. He’d get one of those wishes, as Abhishek – who had a stormer of a second half – scored a stunning reverse hit from the edge of the circle past an otherwise brilliant James Mazarelo.\n\nIndia had a good third quarter but couldn’t convert the half-chances they were creating, particularly from PCs. Jugraj Singh, who has a mean drag flick in terms of sheer power, has consistently struggled for accuracy and it happened again as he hit a couple of his attempts well wide. And when they’d have liked to put pressure on GB by starting the fourth quarter strongly, it was actually Will Calnan who struck the decisive blow in just two minutes into the final 15.\n\nIndia huffed and puffed for the rest of the match. Abhishek was unlucky not to have been awarded a penalty stroke for a late tackle on him, Amit Rohidas hit the post from a PC rebound, a couple of other counterattacks fell flat in the final third… and the momentum India had built over the last matches fizzled out with an avoidable defeat.\n\nIt didn’t help that India had to play back-to-back high intensity matches, as Harmanpreet said in the post-match interview, but that’s the nature of this tournament. Player-of-the-match Jacob Draper actually said something that should cause at least mild alarm for Indian hockey fans. “I think it was just the intensity, when we set up,” he suggested, when asked what was the point of difference. “I think the Indians did really well in keeping up with us for a half but as the game went on they started to tire and that’s where our training paid off and we put them to the swords, essentially.”\n\nGiven India have to play Argentina and Ireland first, and then Belgium and Australia on consecutive days at the Paris Olympics, it is an area that Fulton’s side must address. Physical fitness is a controllable factor, and was a crucial detail in India’s Tokyo bronze. It suddenly can’t become an excuse.  \n\n“It’s not easy to play back-to-back with different teams. We created so many chances today for both PCs and field goals, we needed to convert them, but couldn’t do that today. We need to learn from the mistakes in this match. We need to be calm and smart inside the circle, especially with short corners. We got so many PCs and didn’t score a goal,” Harmanpreet reflected after the match.\n\nFulton had told The Indian Express recently that he believes India have it in them to win gold in Paris but realistically, their level isn’t there yet. It is a quest for that consistency now.\n\n Vinayakk Mohanarangan is Senior Assistant Editor and is based in New Delhi.                        ... Read More \n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

Thinaah (women’s doubles) could not bounce back as all did not make it past the last eight in the Singapore Open.\n\nWorld No. 5 Aaron-Wooi Yik looked far from their best when they tamely went down 10-21, 14-21 to Denmark’s world No. 4 Kim Astrup-Anders Skaarup Rasmussen in the quarter-finals while world No. 9 Tang Jie-Ee Wei lost out 14-21, 18-21 to South Korea’s reigning world champions Seo Seung-jae-Chae Yu-jung in the same stage.Meanwhile, world No. 13 Pearly-Thinaah were no match for China’s world No. 3 Liu Shengshu-Tan Ning and suffered a 10-21, 10-21 defeat in the first round.\n\nTang Jie-Ee Wei and Pearly-Thinaah lost in the semi-finals of the Malaysian tourney despite the absence of the world’s top pairs while Aaron-Wooi Yik went down in the last eight.\n\nNational coaching director Rexy Mainaky acknowledged that the pairs, who are all in the Road to Gold (RTG) Olympics programme, had to improve quickly with the showpiece event just two months away.\n\n“Pearly-Thinaah’s performance was well below our expectations while Tang Jie-Ee Wei are still lacking maturity and not playing like a top 10 pair,” said Rexy.\n\n“The latter cannot always depend on coaches to tell them what to do and they need to know by now how to handle the situation on court.\n\n“They were leading 15-9 in the second game against the Koreans but wanted to finish off the game too fast and ended up losing.”\n\nOn Aaron-Wooi Yik’s showing, Rexy said: “Wooi Yik’s game was all over the place from the beginning against the Danish pair. He played like he had no plan. His position when smashing and his net play was all over the place.\n\n“Denmark also played well. They did not play a fast game but were patient.”\n\nAaron-Wooi Yik, Tang Jie-Ee Wei and Pearly-Thinaah have one last opportunity to get it right before the Olympics when they compete next in the Indonesian Open, which starts on Tuesday.\n\nRexy wants to help his charges regain their confidence ahead of the tournament.\n\n“We need to work out how to help them to get back their confidence,” said Rexy.\n\n“Psychologist Frederick Tan will have heart-to-heart talks with them.”\n\nThank you for your report!\n\nCopyright © 1995-\n            \n\n Star Media Group Berhad [197101000523 (10894-D)]\n\nBest viewed on Chrome browsers.\n\n\n\nWe would love to keep you posted on the latest promotion.

The doubles defeat followed another in straight sets against Stan Wawrinka in the first round of the singles.\n\nThe 37-year-old has been playing at Roland Garros after recovering ahead of schedule from damaged ankle ligaments and is still trying to find his best tennis. He is gearing up for what is expected to be his final shot at Wimbledon next month before a potential retirement after the Olympic Games in Paris.\n\nMurray won the Davis Cup alongside his elder sibling and has revealed that they are considering a reunion for Wimbledon, which starts on July 1 in SW19. “I may do, yeah. I’m not 100 per cent sure yet,” he said.\n\n“My brother doesn’t have a partner for Wimbledon currently. We have spoken a little bit about it. So [I] may do that, but I’m not 100 per cent sure yet. I mean obviously Jamie could also get a good partner, as well. We’ll see what happens, but yeah, we’ll probably decide in the next few days, probably.”\n\nThe three-time Grand Slam champion was disappointed with how things went with Evans, especially considering the tennis at the Olympics will be played at the same venue later this summer. “I guess for both of us it was kind of an opportunity to put our names in the frame to play the Olympics,” he said.\n\n“Me and Dan obviously were hoping to have a good run here. But it wasn’t to be. So I don’t know if we’ll get the opportunity. There’s guys obviously ahead of us in the rankings, and we’ve got good doubles players in the UK. Let’s see what happens.\n\n“It was an opportunity to have a good run and didn’t happen. I don’t regret it. Obviously when you lose, if you could have said, ‘OK, you’re going to lose in the first round’ four days ago, yeah, you would regret sticking around.\n\n“I felt like we had a good chance to do well and we agreed if we were going to play, we would play to try and win the tournament. So no I don’t regret playing at all.\n\n\"I have been struggling a little bit with my back the last couple of weeks, so I probably needed a few lighter days anyway. Yeah, I’ll get a chance to get home, start preparing on the grass and hopefully get a few good tournaments there.”\n\nAt Reach and across our entities we and our partners use information collected through cookies and other identifiers from your device to improve experience on our site, analyse how it is used and to show personalised advertising.

Jackson has three silver medals (2000, 2004, 2008) and one bronze (2012).\n\n—Satou Sabally, Germany: She helped Germany qualify for its first Olympics and is one of the top young players in the WNBA, where she plays for the Dallas Wings.\n\n—A’ja Wilson, United States: One of the top faces of the tournament, Wilson has been a winner everywhere she has played, winning an NCAA title at South Carolina, two WNBA championships with the Las Vegas Aces and Olympic gold in Tokyo.\n\n—Emma Meesseman, Belgium: She helped Belgium reach the quarterfinals at Tokyo three years ago.\n\n—Megan Gustafson, Spain: After playing in college at Iowa, the Wisconsin native went through the naturalization process so she could play for Spain, which finished sixth at the Tokyo Olympics. She now plays for the WNBA’s Las Vegas Aces.\n\n—The U.S. hasn’t lost a game since the 1992 Olympics. It has an incredible frontcourt in Wilson, Breanna Stewart and Brittney Griner, who will be playing in her first international game since spending 10 months in a Russian jail in 2022. Can the Americans win gold for an eighth consecutive Olympics?\n\n\n\n\n—While the U.S. is a heavy favorite to repeat, the other medal spots are up for grabs. Japan got silver in Tokyo, but the team has since undergone a lot of change, including a new coach. Host France is a medal contender after winning the bronze three years ago. China won the silver medal at the 2022 World Cup and will try to earn its first Olympic medal since 1992.\n\nThe competition begins July 28 in Lille, France, with the preliminary round continuing until Aug. 4. The elimination rounds will be played in Paris, with the quarterfinals on Aug. 7, the semifinals two days later and the medal games on Aug. 11, the final day of the Olympics.\n\nThe U.S. has won the last seven gold medals.\n\n___\n\nAP Summer Olympics: https://apnews.com/hub/2024-paris-olympic-games\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCopyright 2025 The Associated Press.

Chosen by Michael Edwards as the man best suited to replace the legendary Jurgen Klopp, the 45-year-old will hope to continue the excellent work and success of his predecessor at Liverpool.\n\nAnd while he inherits a Liverpool squad in the rudest of health, Slot has identified a number of key ways in which to strengthen the side and ensure the Reds can go a few steps better than the season just gone, which ultimately ended in something of a damp note.\n\nGO DEEPER 👉 Five Liverpool players facing potential Anfield axe when Arne Slot moves to Merseyside\n\nTo clear the decks, Slot, alongside Edwards and Hughes, has decided that Joel Matip, Adrian and Thiago Alcantara can all leave Anfield at the end of their contracts, with replacements for all three likely to be sought.\n\nSlot has already recommended a number of options in each position and TEAMtalk understands that the Dutchman, alongside Hughes and Edwards has drawn up a pecking order of would-be options for each position.\n\nA new attacker could also yet be sought, though such a move would only happen were one of their big-name stars to depart. As it stands, though, there is currently a degree of uncertainty surrounding all of Mo Salah  – whom Slot wants to keep – Luis Diaz and Darwin Nunez.\n\nOne position Slot has, though, identified as a priority is a new No 6.\n\nLiverpool struggled somewhat to cover the position last season with Alexis Mac Allister first asked to play as the deepest of their midfielders before Klopp quickly realised the Argentine’s best position was as a No 8.\n\nAnother summer signing, Wataru Endo, took time to settle but did soon prove his worth, though was in and out of the side too.\n\nAt 31, though, the Japan international is only seen as a short-term fix.\n\nAs a result, Slot is prioritising the signing of a new holding midfielder and now a respected Argentinian journalist has claimed talks are underway over a deal to bring Porto star Varela to Anfield.\n\nThe 22-year-old only moved to Porto in August 2023, arriving in a bargain €8m deal from Boca Juniors, with a further €3m in add-ons.\n\nDON’T MISS 🔴 Liverpool midfield targets: EVERY option linked for the summer 2024 transfer window\n\nQuickly establishing himself as one of the best No 6s in the Portuguese Primeira Liga, the Argentina international has quickly sprung to the attention of a number of top sides.\n\nAmong them are Liverpool and Eduardo Burgos claims Reds sporting director Hughes has already opened talks over a deal.\n\nHis buyout clause stands at €70m (£59.7m) – a fee the Reds are seemingly ready to meet, with Boca due a percentage of any sale.\n\nVarela is yet to make his senior international debut for Argentina, but will be included in their squad for this summer’s Paris Olympics, with the Reds keen to tie down his signature before the competition gets underway on Wednesday 24 July.\n\nWith Slot ready to assess his squad after the summer break, one man he will unlikely be able to depend on is squad player Sepp van den Berg, whom has spent a series of spells out on loan since his arrival at Liverpool back in 2019.\n\nThe most recent of these came with Mainz and now the 22-year-old, who has just four LFC appearances to his name, is determined to quit.\n\nIn a report run by De Telegraaf, they claim Van den Berg feels his career is being stifled by the Reds and that he now knows he needs to move on to take his career to the next level.\n\nA permanent move to Mainz has been mooted but the Reds’ alleged €20m asking price looks set to put them off.\n\nIn his report, Marcel van der Kraan noted: “But here too, the well-spoken and down-to-earth Dutchman does not want to be used as a plaything again. He sees it this way: ‘You have not radiated confidence in me all this time, but you do want to hinder my future. I want to continue playing every week and further develop myself.\n\n“All the broken promises from his club have not made him bitter, but they have caused the love for Liverpool to cool down.\n\n“Arne Slot wants to see him at work in the preparation, just like his predecessor Klopp. But Van den Berg wants to choose his own path and make a transfer. He is now one of the best defenders in the Bundesliga, and also one of the four fastest central defenders in that competition.\n\n“As a result, clubs in Germany, the Netherlands and England are queuing up. He wants to make his own choice.”\n\n\n\nVan den Berg made 35 appearances for Mainz this season as they finished 13th in the Bundesliga, with the centre-half scoring three goals.\n\n\n                        A player Liverpool sold for a package worth £25m has indicated he'd love to re-join the Reds, though he'll only do so on one condition                    \n\n\n                © Planet Sport Limited 2025 • All Rights Reserved\n            "

Yet the divide between men's and women's football remains a burden behind the scenes.\n\nElise Kellond-Knight knows it all too well. She made her debut for Australia in 2007 and brought up her 115th cap last year. She missed the 2023 World Cup at home after rupturing her anterior cruciate ligament. That was her second ACL tear.\n\nWatch the 2024 UEFA Champions League final between Real Madrid and Borussia Dortmund on June 2 AEST, streaming ad free and live on Stan Sport\n\nBoth times she blew her knee out she was on her period. The first she puts down to bad motor mechanics, trying to pivot too quickly. The second was when she was shoved in the back and planted heavily. She believes menstruation predisposed her to the injuries.\n\nKatrina Gorry of the Matildas celebrates with her teammates Sam Kerr and Elise Kellond-Knight of the Matildas after scoring a goal during the Women's Olympic Football Tournament Qualifier match in 2020. Mark Kolbe via Getty Images\n\nA sudden change of direction, twisting, and landing heavily are often when the ACL lets go. The recovery time from the injury is at least nine months.\n\nA 2016 study found female footballers were 2.8 times more likely to suffer an ACL tear than their male counterparts.\n\nREAD MORE: 'I'm not happy': 'Frustrated' Ricciardo's blunt admission\n\nREAD MORE: 'Rarely gets a headline': Most underrated NRL players\n\nREAD MORE:  Foxx optimistic about injury forced withdrawal\n\nThere are various theories as to why that may be. The aforementioned study claimed there was no consensus in the scientific community that sex hormones play a part in an increased incidence of ACL injury in women.\n\nHowever, Kellond-Knight said the trend among athletes she's spoken to is that more often than not they injure their knee mid-cycle.\n\nElise Kellond-Knight speaks to the media during a Matildas media opportunity in 2023. Quinn Rooney via Getty Images\n\nShe says it's not something that's often spoken about between players and their respective clubs, but the increase in incidence over the past 18 months alone has pushed clubs to start taking the theory seriously.\n\n\"I think hormones are probably one of the biggest research areas that might reveal something,\" she told Wide World of Sports.\n\n\"I've had two ACL injuries. The moment of your cycle where your hormones are at, for me personally, was the same moment (of injury).\n\n\"The amount of ACLs when a girl is on her period is enormous. There has to be something hormonal going on there.\n\n\"They're tracking the girls' cycles. They're doing research at their club level. It's fascinating. \n\n\"When your hormones are at a certain level they affect your strength. Hormones directly relate to women's strength. How do we do more research into that?\n\n\"After doing two ACLs at that time of my cycle, I'm hyper-aware if it is that time if I go into a game – high risk. Maybe you do take a little bit more caution. After two injuries you don't want any more.\n\n\"It's not spoken about. It's under-researched. As players, we know. Anyone with an ACL (injury) we always ask 'Were you on your period?'\"\n\nA fan holds up a banner wishing Sam Kerr to get well soon following her ACL injury. Visionhaus/Getty Images\n\nWomen's football globally has had something of an ACL epidemic. Sam Kerr was among a throng of world class players to suffer an ACL injury last year and she'll miss the Paris Olympics as a result.\n\nA Sky Sports investigation earlier this year found 195 women had suffered an ACL injury over the 18 months prior.\n\nHigh-profile players Leah Williamson and Beth Mead (England), Janine Beckie (Canada), Delphine Cascarino and Marie-Antoinette Katoto (France), Vivianne Miedema (Netherlands), Christen Press and Catarina Macario (United States) all missed the World Cup.\n\nSuch is the seriousness of the issue that UEFA commissioned an expert panel on women's health in 2023 to better understand the problem.\n\nBeth Mead of Arsenal receives medical treatment during the FA Women's Super League match between Arsenal and Manchester United in 2022 after blowing her ACL out.  Harriet Lander via Getty Images\n\nThe UEFA panel will gather insights from players, coaches, physicians, physiotherapists, and even parents. The aim is to publish a consensus on ACL injury prevention and management this year.\n\nEven at face value, the problem is complex. Biomechanically, ACL notch width index is smaller between men and women, however, that's not a definitive weakness.\n\nKellond-Knight says menstruation timing is one thing but she believes women are inherently disadvantaged, at least in Australia.\n\nUnlike men, a lot of women compete part-time in the A-Leagues. She believes the absence of a year-long training program coupled with an increase in load as women's football grows are contributing factors.\n\n\"It's a four-week pre-season and we had several ACLs within the first two weeks. No-brainer, those two things are related if you only give us four weeks to train at that top level,\" said Kellond-Knight.\n\n\"Everyone goes back into an NPL-level (National Premier Leagues Victoria) environment, you're training less, you're training less intense, you're deconditioned, then you go back into an A-League environment, you've got four weeks to prepare. Of course, injuries are going to happen. Any change in load will be high risk for an injury.\"\n\n(From left) Chloe Logarzo of Western United, Elise Kellond-Knight of Melbourne Victory, Kyah Simon of Central Coast Mariners, and Cortnee Vine of Sydney FC pose during the A-Leagues season launch. Mark Metcalfe via Getty Images\n\nIronically, the game's rapid growth is to the detriment of its players in Kellond-Knight's view.\n\n\"Players are playing a lot more minutes than what they were previously conditioned to. Men who have years to develop and adapt to that so I think stuff like that ties into that,\" she explained.\n\nUltimately, Kellond-Knight yearns for more female-focused research. Training models and data, she said, are mostly male-based.\n\nEven something as simple as a football boot and stud pattern designed specifically for women would be, for lack of a better term, a step in the right direction.\n\nThere are positive signs, however. The sheer volume of ACL injuries has governing bodies and football clubs taking action.\n\n\"FIFA has started an initiative where they're specifically looking at the female ACL. A lot of money is being put into it,\" said Kellond-Knight.\n\n\"There has been a lot of research on this at the end of the day with too many variables. Finally, people are starting to take it quite serious. \n\n\"A lot of the clubs are looking at hormone levels as well. Like things that haven't been looked at previously because they don't relate to men. So why would anyone investigate hormone levels in sport because only men play sport? We didn't care about that, but now that the female game is professionalized and actually have to take into consideration the female cycles, like what happens in the body. \n\n\"Also like small things like boots are made for men. So are they trialling and testing football boots in females? No, they're not. So when will we get a different stud pattern to men that will accommodate for our hips, knees, et cetera? Stuff like that needs to start changing.\"\n\nElise Kellond-Knight will be part of Stan Sport's talent line-up for the Paris 2024 Olympic Games.\n\n4 minutes ago\n\n26 minutes ago\n\n54 minutes ago\n\n© 2025 Nine Entertainment Co."

The man wanted to attack the Olympic events “to die and become a martyr”, the statement also said.\n\nFrance is on its highest security alert ahead of the Paris Olympics and Paralympics, which are expected to draw millions of visitors, and run from 26 July to 11 August.\n\nFootball matches will take place in cities across France before the final in Paris’ Stade de France.\n\nDarmanin did not cite a specific security threat against the football event, but has said there are multiple potential threats, including those from Islamic extremist groups, violent environmental activists, far-right groups and cyberattacks from Russia or other adversaries.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\nThe Paris Olympics organising committee said it was made aware of the arrest and praised intelligence and security services.\n\n“Security is the highest priority of Paris 2024.

        "expanded content": "The T20 World Cup starts in the US this weekend and, while the Caribbean is hosting more games, there is little doubt where the potential for growth lies\n\nSpread across six Caribbean countries and the United States of America, where some folks believe sits gold in them thar hills, the men’s T20 World Cup that whirs into life in Dallas on Saturday night may well be cricket’s most ambitious global event to date.\n\nIt certainly feels the most inclusive of any format, men or women. A record 20 teams start in four groups of five – no preliminary qualifier here – and first-timers USA, Canada and Uganda are among nine associate nations. Then there are the logistics, be it the zig-zagging travel – organisers liaising with seven separate governments – or the mind-bending 34,000-seat modular stadium on Long Island, New York that has been rapidly assembled like an Ikea flat-pack on steroids.\n\nNassau County International Cricket Stadium, to give it its full name, will host the biggest game of all – a central pillar of the International Cricket Council’s new $3bn (£2.3bn) broadcast deal – when India take on Pakistan in Group A next Sunday. It is one of three grounds being used in the US, where 16 of the 55 matches will take place. They all come in the first round before the Caribbean takes control. But while it may not be a full-blown bugle charge on to American soil, cricket is finally scratching its itch of manifest destiny.\n\nAnd, who knows, perhaps this ninth edition of the tournament formerly known as the World T20 will be the one that finally cements its primacy. Given the unstoppable spread of Twenty20 cricket in recent years, and questions about the future of its 50-over sibling during the more exclusive 10-team World Cup in India six months ago, it feels only a matter of time before the T20 World Cup becomes the Cricket World Cup.\n\nThe answer to this one may be still a little way off, it should be said, with two more 50-over men’s World Cups sold to broadcasters up until 2031 and that format still the stage where the stars of both red- and white-ball cricket convene and show off their skills. And it may also hinge on the success or otherwise of the next four weeks, as a blend of the sport’s traditional big beasts and its optimistic underdogs duke it out on both sides of the Caribbean Sea. On paper, at least, this one looks ripe for some jeopardy.\n\nThis comes with the territory, of course, T20 being the sport’s most capricious and volatile format; a game where, on any given day, just one or two heroes can bend the script to their will. But while this is witnessed regularly in the T20 leagues that now swamp the calendar – the Indian Premier League’s ticker-tape having only recently settled after last week’s final – the national pride, the rivalries, and the tantalising prospect of giant-killings means a World Cup touches the parts that the franchise world cannot.\n\nCan Rohit Sharma’s India shake off the fatigue of that two-month IPL and show the 50-over final defeat in Ahmedabad last November was but a flesh wound? Perhaps England, boosted by Jofra Archer’s return, can put up an actual title defence this time, having relinquished that One Day International crown so meekly. It almost goes without saying that no side will want to face Australia come the sharp end, their big-game mentality so enviable and their squad stacked with champions.\n\nThe field is far wider than the so-called Big Three, however, all of whom could yet be also-rans. A personal tip is West Indies, blessed with home advantage, power-hitters, and set to be fuelled by a heady soca vibe in the stands, while teams such as Pakistan, runners-up in 2022, and New Zealand, knockout-stage regulars, can never be discounted. South Africa appear to have all the tools also. But each group has a third, possibly even fourth side that could yet pilfer one of the top two spots that leads to the rapid-fire Super Eight phase (aka two more groups of four that decide the semi-finals).\n\nThe question of whether cricket can crack America, as per the cliche, feels unlikely to be answered (not least on a subscription channel, Willow TV), although this T20 World Cup is not a one-off moonshot, rather one shoulder to the wheel of a broader push. As well as T20 cricket making its debut in the Los Angeles Olympics in 2028, there is already the nascent Major Cricket League. It boasts owners with deep pockets (four of the six teams are IPL satellites) and, as per Andy Bull’s eye-catching report in the Guardian earlier this week, it has ambitions for rapid expansion in the coming years.\n  For all the understandable focus on this new frontier, the T20 World Cup is primarily a Caribbean affair and a pretty big deal for the region too. Cricket West Indies is expecting a $25m (£20m) windfall from hosting, as well as $300m (£235m) worth of economic activity across the host countries of Barbados, Antigua, St Lucia, St Vincent, Trinidad and Guyana. With the tournament extending the usual tourist season by an extra month, all six governments have invested in stadium upgrades, such as LED floodlights, new big screens and additional capacity.\n\nSign up to The Spin\n\nSubscribe to our cricket newsletter for our writers' thoughts on the biggest stories and a review of the week’s action\n\nafter newsletter promotion\n\nTeams will also be able to travel straight from the runway to their hotels on arrival, likewise the TV crews can take their equipment to the stadiums for customs checks there. For travelling fans, entry into one Caribbean country will automatically mean a visa for all. “Logistically it is a huge challenge but not something we’re not used to,” says Johnny Grave, the Englishman who serves as chief executive of CWI. “We’re blessed that the political leaders in the Caribbean are all so supportive of cricket.”\n\nUnlike the sanitised and soulless 2007 men’s World Cup, and more akin to the 2010 World T20, a carnival atmosphere is being sought. Supporters will be able to bring cool boxes, instruments and flags into the grounds, with tickets starting as low as $6.\n\nIf there is one quibble here, it is that 25 of the 55 games – including the final at Kensington Oval in Bridgetown, Barbados on 29 June – will start at 10.30am to serve the Indian TV audience. “We pushed for as many evening games as possible,” adds Grave. “But clearly compromises had to be made on behalf of the game, not least when the Indian TV market is putting in 90% of the broadcast revenue.” As such, the first sips of rum punch may well have a slight taste of toothpaste."

In an interview with CBS News Sunday Morning that will air Sunday, Ledecky expressed concern that she and many others won’t be competing on a level playing field at what could be her fourth Olympics in France.\n\n“It’s hard going into Paris knowing that we’re going to be racing some of these athletes,” said Ledecky, who will be at US Olympic trials starting on 15 June. “And I think our faith in some of the systems is at an all-time low.”\n\nAmong Ledecky’s medals in Tokyo three years ago was a silver from the 4x200-meter freestyle relay that China won. Last month, the New York Times and German broadcaster ARD reported that 23 Chinese swimmers tested positive for a performance-enhancing drug in the months leading up to those Olympics, where some of the Chinese swimmers who tested positive were allowed to compete.\n\nChinese authorities did not penalize the athletes after determining the drug had entered the swimmers’ systems through contamination. The World Anti-Doping Agency accepted that explanation, saying in part that it had very little chance of winning an appeal had it opened a case.\n\nLedecky, whose six individual Olympic golds is a women’s record, said “it doesn’t seem like everything was followed to a ‘T’” regarding the handling of the case.\n\n“I’d like to see some accountability here,” she said. “I’d like to see some answers as to why this happened the way it did. And I’d really like to see that steps are taken for the future so that we can regain some confidence in the global system.”\n\nWada hired a Swiss lawyer to conduct a review of the way the case was handled, but critics have said the probe is too narrow and not truly independent. Ledecky added to a chorus of athletes who would like to see more transparency about the case that figures to cast a shadow over swimming in Paris.\n\n“I think the whole case has to be reexamined independently and thoroughly,” she said, “and all the information needs to be out there.”"

It was the first such thwarted plot targeting the Games, which start in eight weeks as France is on its highest threat alert level.\n\nGerald Darmanin said in a statement that members of the General Directorate of Internal Security arrested an 18-year-old man from Chechnya on May 22 on suspicion of being behind a plan to attack soccer events that will be held in the southern city of Saint-Etienne.\n\nAccording to the initial investigation, the man was preparing an attack targeting the Geoffroy-Guichard stadium in Saint-Etienne that will host several soccer matches during the Summer Games. The planned attack was to target spectators and police forces, the statement said. The suspect wanted to attack the Olympic events “to die and become a martyr,\" the statement also said.\n\nThe Paris Olympics will run from July 26-Aug. 11. Soccer matches will take place in cities across France before the final in Paris’ Stade de France.\n\nFrance is on in its highest security alert ahead of the Paris Olympics and Paralympics, which are expected to draw millions of visitors.\n\nDarmanin, the interior minister, did not cite a specific security threat against the soccer event, but has said there are multiple potential threats, including those from Islamic extremist groups, violent environmental activists, far-right groups and cyberattacks from Russia or other adversaries.\n\nThe Paris Olympics organizing committee said it was made aware of the arrest and praised intelligence and security services. ‘’Security is the highest priority of Paris 2024. We are working daily in close coordination with the Interior Ministry and all stakeholders — and will continue to be fully mobilized,'' it said in a statement.\n\nSecurity concerns are notably high for the the exceptional opening ceremony, which brings more than 100 world leaders to the French capital. It involves boats carrying athletes along the Seine River on a 6-kilometer (3.7-mile) open-air parade and huge crowds watching from the embankments.\n\nIn April, French President Emmanuel Macron said the July 26 opening ceremony could be moved instead to the country’s national stadium if the security threat is deemed too high.\n\nOrganizers had originally planned to host as many as 600,000 people, most watching free of charge from riverbanks. But security and logistical concerns have led the government to progressively scale back its ambitions. Earlier this year, the overall number of spectators was reduced to around 300,000.\n\nThe French government also decided that tourists won’t be given free access to watch the opening ceremony because of security concerns. Free access will be invitation-only instead.\n\nExtra security is also on hand for the Olympic torch relay, which passed on Friday through the monastery outcropping of Mont-Saint-Michel, which sees thousands of tourists daily.\n\nBack to Homepage\n\nMust-Read Stories"

He'd certainly welcome the chance to follow in his father's footsteps. \n\n\"It sounds like it'd be a lot of fun and be a cool opportunity,\" the 17-year-old from Lake Country, B.C. said. \"Obviously, I don't know exactly how things are going to shake out and I try not to speculate too much, but yeah, I know they're there at pick nine and I guess we'll just have to see how it goes. But that would be definitely pretty cool.\"\n\nThe elder Iginla, now a special advisor to Flames general manager Craig Conroy, played a record 1,219 games for the Flames and also owns the all-time franchise marks for goals (525) and points (1,095). \n\nThe younger Iginla, who was traded from the Seattle Thunderbirds to Kelowna last summer, scored 47 goals and piled up 84 points in 64 Western Hockey League games this season. He added nine goals and 15 points in 11 playoff games and then racked up six goals and 12 points in seven games at the under-18 World Championship en route to a gold medal with Team Canada. \n\nAs a result, he's rocketed up draft lists and may not even be on the board when the Flames pick. TSN director of scouting Craig Button has Iginla all the way up at No. 4 in his latest list of top prospects.  \n\n\"That's pretty special to hear,\" he said. \"From the beginning of the year I've moved up a lot of lists, and that's kind of been cool for me to see. [My] vision that I kind of had at the beginning year was to try to chip away at some of those lists and keep improving in all areas of the game. It's been a lot of fun and should continue to be fun going into the draft.\"\n\nAs he prepares for next week's scouting combine in Buffalo, Iginla spoke to TSN about how his game evolved this season. He also shared the best advice he's received from his Hall of Fame dad. The following is an edited version of the conversation.  \n\nTSN: How did you make such a big jump this year? \n\nTij Iginla: Just being able to be at home here [Lake Country is a short drive from Kelowna] and working with my dad in the garage or the shooting area every day, just trying to keep honing my skills, stick handling, shooting, all those things, makes such a difference on the ice. So, I think just getting to be at home has been really good for me to keep on improving. But, at the same time, also just maturing my game as a whole and getting to play in all situations has helped me a lot as well. \n\nTSN: What made you so effective at that the under-18 World Championship?\n\nTij Iginla: That was something super special to be a part of. We had a great group and to get the opportunity to go all the way over to Finland, which is the furthest I've been, was really cool. Coming out of the WHL playoffs, playing a strong team in the Prince George Cougars, helped prepare me for the type of hockey that I was going to see over there. I had some great linemates, great guys to play with, so that definitely helped as well. To go through the journey we did as a team, and ultimately to cap it off with a win in the gold-medal game, is something I'll never forget. \n\nTSN: You also excelled in the WHL playoffs. What's the key to handling pressure? \n\nTij Iginla: I know how important it is to be someone who, when the games are bigger, you show up in those games, and that's something that I try to do. I feel like a lot of players can be good in the easy games, but the big games are kind of where it counts. I just try to prepare as best as I can for those games and try to be ready to go out and work as hard and compete as hard as I can. That's my mindset going into those big games.\n\nTSN: After winning the gold medal, it was really cool to see you posing for a picture alongside your dad. What's the best advice he's given you? \n\nTij Iginla: That's a tough one, because he's definitely given me tons of advice. I've learned so much from him over the years. One of the big things is just to believe that everything's going to work out. Wherever you are today, if you're facing adversity or whatever it is, just keep things in perspective and believe you're here for a reason and everything's going to work out for the best.  \n\nTSN: How are you similar to your dad? \n\nTij Iginla: It's a little hard for me to say because what I can remember is how he played in the back part of his career. From what I saw then, I think he was a pretty big shooter, pretty good goal scorer, and that's something I try to do myself. I've definitely learned a lot from him in those areas over the years. So, I'd say that would be one of the big things. I didn't get to see his prime live, which would've been cool, but I'll go with some of the shooting things he's taught me. \n\nTSN: How has he helped you in that department? \n\nTij Iginla: He's helped me so much with my shot. He knows a lot, but at the same time it's just getting out there and getting the reps in. So, getting to be back home, like I was talking about earlier, is something I've been super grateful for. We're out there pretty much every day working on things. He's passing me pucks, giving me one timers, things like that, so talking about the mechanics and stuff, but also then just getting in the reps as well. \n\nTSN: You missed your dad's prime, but what's the best story you heard about him? \n\nTij Iginla: The golden goal [at the 2010 Olympics], you hear about that quite a bit. I was there, but I don't quite remember it. That would be cool to experience now that I'm a little bit older. That one is probably the No. 1. \n\nTSN: What is your most vivid memory of your dad when you were growing up around the game?\n\nTij Iginla: We were living in Colorado when he was playing there and he was kind of an older, veteran guy, and he became pretty good buddies with Nathan MacKinnon. I remember one Thanksgiving we had him over to the house for dinner, so that was pretty cool. That's something that I can remember pretty vividly. \n\nTSN: What stood out being around MacKinnon back then? \n\nTij Iginla: It was cool. He was just super down to earth and such a nice guy. I was still pretty young, still sitting at the kid table for Thanksgiving. Yeah, that was pretty special. \n\nTSN: What's the biggest difference between you and your dad? \n\nTij Iginla: Ah, I don't know. I think we're definitely similar in a lot of ways. In his era, he had to be a little bit tougher and kind of run up his penalty minutes a little bit more, so I guess I'll go with that for a difference. \n\nTSN: You had a fight this year. Has he given you any advice on that side of the game? \n\nTij Iginla: Yeah, he's given me a little bit of advice there as well. Just a couple techniques and stuff, but nothing too crazy. \n\nTSN: What's it like learning from your dad while also trying to make a name for yourself? \n\nTij Iginla: I'll hear a lot of questions about it, but I wouldn't trade it for the world, you know, having him in my corner and getting to learn everything from him. So that's been something I'm super grateful for. So, if I have to take an extra questions about him then I'll do it.  \n\nTSN: Do you hear about it from players on other teams? \n\nTij Iginla: Yeah a decent amount. I hear a lot about that and a lot about how I'm just here because of my dad and stuff like that. But it's nothing that I'm not used to. \n\nTSN: Does it fire you up at all? \n\nTij Iginla: Yeah, sometimes it fires me up a little bit. But it's nothing that I haven't heard before, so they got to come up with some new ones. \n\nTSN: Who do you model your style after in the current game? Button sees you as a mix of Colorado's Gabe Landeskog and Boston's Brad Marchand. \n\nTij Iginla: That's a nice compliment to hear. Obviously, those are two pretty spectacular NHL players, so that's really cool to hear. I try to look at the top guys in the league and the most dominant guys and try to study them and take what I can. A guy I like to look at would be MacKinnon. He's so unreal in so many areas of the game. He's such a great offensive mind, but he can be trusted in all three zones. He's just super well-rounded. So, guys like him and [Connor] McDavid and kind of all those top guys in the league, I try to study them and be as much like them as I can. \n\nTSN: Your dad was picked 11th overall in the 1995 NHL draft. Will you have some bragging rights if you get picked higher? \n\nTij Iginla: Yeah, maybe a little bit, but he had a pretty strong career as well. The draft only means so much. I'll have to start chipping away at those other achievements as well if I want to get those bragging rights.  \n\nTSN: What was your goal at the start of the year in terms of the draft? \n\nTij Iginla: Nothing too specific. I try to keep the focus on just getting better and becoming the best player I can be. However the draft shakes out, wherever I do go, I'm just kind of trusting that will be the best spot for me and then whatever happens, happens. I don't want to be like, 'Oh I need to be this spot or this spot,' because at the end of the day the draft only means so much. It's kind of about what you do after, so to keep it in perspective is important for me as well.  \n\n© 2025\n\n All rights reserved.\n            "

He intended to attack spectators but also security forces and die as a martyr.”\n\nThe revelations could set nerves jangling in France where organisers have faced persistent questions about the risk of an attack that would seriously tarnish the world’s biggest sporting event.\n\nMost concerns have focused on the opening ceremony on 26 July, which will take place over a four-mile stretch of the Seine – the first time a summer Olympics has begun outside the athletics stadium.\n\nPolicing such a vast area of the capital represents a huge challenge: 45,000 officers will be on duty and large swathes of the centre will be out of bounds for everyone except ticket holders and local residents.\n\nFrance has been targeted by Islamist attackers over the last decade, often by individuals inspired by al-Qaida or Islamic State (IS). In October last year a radicalised 20-year-old Chechen, who had sworn allegiance to IS, killed a teacher in the northern French town of Arras.\n\nIn March, the interior minister, Gérald Darmanin, told a French senate commission that the type of risk under assessment for the period of the Olympics included the possibility of a move by a lone attacker in France, or groups outside France paying criminals inside the country to stage an attack.\n\nDarmanin said there was no specific threat from a foreign group at that point. “We can say today that groups such as al-Qaida or Islamic State have the intention to attack the west, and France in particular, but they don’t have the means at the moment.” But, he added, intelligence was not a “precise science”.\n\nSign up to This is Europe\n\nThe most pressing stories and debates for Europeans – from identity to economics to the environment\n\nafter newsletter promotion\n\nCéline Berthon, the French domestic intelligence chief, told the same senate commission that the terrorism risk had been increasing for more than a year. She spoke of “the return of an Islamist terrorism threat linked to external theatres, which we must not lose sight of, amid a tense geopolitical context, with terrorist organisations who target the west and will no doubt, as the event approaches, seize the opportunity which the Games are”.\n\nThe Olympic torch relay is under way in France, involving a “security bubble” of 100 officers including anti-drone specialists and anti-terror police.\n\nDuring the first three weeks of the 7,500-mile (12,000km) trip, 78 people were arrested for trying to disrupt the relay and 30 suspect drones were intercepted, according to figures from the interior ministry this week.\n\nThe Olympics have been attacked in the past, most infamously in 1972 in Munich and again in 1996 in Atlanta."

Scored 16 goals for RB Salzburg in the Austrian Bundesliga last season and the Slovenian has carried on that good form in Germany with Leipzig this campaign.\n\nVIKTOR GYOKERES (Sporting Lisbon, value £60m-£80m)\n\nBeen scouted several times this season. The Swedish striker, 25, is more of a traditional No 9 so may not suit Arsenal’s demand for flexibility but would bring a physicality that boss Mikel Arteta craves.\n\nALEXANDER ISAK (Newcastle, value £75m-£85m)\n\nImpressed in his first two seasons in English football. The Swede, 24, has the pace and finesse to match his finishing ability, and Eddie Howe’s Toon may need to sell to balance the books this summer.\n\nJOSHUA ZIRKZEE (Bologna, value £45m-£50m)\n\nDutch wonder  is attracting the attentions of clubs across Europe. At 6ft 4in the 22-year-old forward would have no trouble adapting to the Premier League and already has an eye for goal.\n\nXAVI SIMONS (RB Leipzig, value £70m-£80m)\n\nAn incredible talent in the Bukayo Saka mould, currently on loan from Paris Saint-Germain. The future of the Dutch attacker, 20, depends on how much money his parent club want to make from him.\n\nHe could become a familiar face to England fans, with him leading the line for Slovenia at the upcoming Euros.\n\nSlovenia are in group B alongside England, Denmark and Serbia.\n\nAccording to The Mirror, Sesko has already \"said yes\" to the idea of a move to Arsenal and would favour moving there over United or Chelsea.\n\nUnlike other Premier League rivals, the Gunners are in good financial shape when it comes to financial rules but are ready to sell a few players off in order to give themselves more flexibility when it comes to spending.\n\n\n\nAlongside Zinchenko, Aaron Ramsdale, Eddie Nketiah and Emile Smith Rowe could all be sold this summer.\n\nMeanwhile, the Gunners have told the French Football Federation that defender William Saliba will not be available for selection at this summer's Olympic Games.\n\nFrance are the host nation and will be managed by Arsenal legend Thierry Henry.\n\nHowever, with Saliba already selected to play at Euro 2024 after playing every single minute of the Premier League campaign - Arsenal want the 23-year-old to get a break before returning for the start of the new season.\n\n\n\nUnlike international European Championships or World Cups the club are under no obligation to release Saliba for the Olympics.\n\nMikel Arteta is looking to get Arsenal ready to beat Man City to the title after another near miss, but he may need to be brutal with his squad in order to do so. Here's SunSport's verdict on who should stay and who should go.\n\nDavid Raya – STAY: Initial doubts arose when he replaced Aaron Ramsdale, but he has since proven himself to be a world-class keeper with all the attributes needed for Arteta’s way of playing.\n\nAaron Ramsdale – GO: Unfortunate to be cast aside for Raya, but is now looking for a move to become a regular No.1 elsewhere, especially with his aspirations of one day starting in goal for England.\n\nKarl Hein - STAY: Unlikely to take Ramsdale’s spot as No.2 should the Englishman depart - but the club cannot afford to lose two keepers in one window.\n\nWilliam Saliba - STAY: Saliba is of the best young defenders in the world right now, Arteta should be building his team around him. A vital part of the side’s spine that conceded just 29 Prem goals this term.\n\nBen White - STAY: Another solid member of Arteta’s impressive back four. Has the flexibility to play on the right or as a central defender, but has made right-back his own this term.\n\nGabriel - STAY: Was on the outskirts at the start of the campaign but forced his way back in and has forged an almighty partnership with Saliba in the middle of the defence. One of Arteta's most important signings.\n\nJurrien Timber - STAY: Yet to see the best of the Dutchman after an injury-hit season, but Arteta views him as a game-changing full-back.\n\nJakub Kiwior - STAY: The Polish international has struggled to break up the duo of Saliba and Gabriel but has impressed when called upon, especially in a stint at left-back.\n\nCedric - GO: Leaving the club with his contract expiring. Never really convinced Arteta he could be relied upon and spent most of the season warming the bench.\n\nTakehiro Tomiyasu - STAY: Another flexible and reliable figure that Arteta adores. Can play centre-back or right-back and is a real presence at set-pieces.\n\nOleksandr Zinchenko - GO: With Timber in line to be Arteta’s first choice at left-back, it is hard to see the Ukrainian starting many games for Arsenal next season. A good signing at £35m but has shown himself to be limited defensively.\n\nThomas Partey - GO: Injury prone and has looked leggy when finally back from his thigh issues that kept him out from October until March. Contract is up next summer.\n\nMartin Odegaard - STAY: Captain fantastic. A real leader amongst men at such a young age. The 25-year-old is on course to lift the Prem at Arsenal sooner rather than later.\n\nEmile Smith Rowe - STAY: Sidelined for most of the term and struggled to make an impact when called upon, but Arteta still sees something in him. A decent squad option but you get the feeling he is running out of time to prove to the club he is a player worth sticking with.\n\nJorginho - STAY: Arteta’s experienced general who, more often than not, has Arsenal playing better with him in the team.\n\nFabio Vieira - GO: Perhaps harsh to judge him based on just 16 appearances in all competitions this season but still looks out of place in English football. A loan move could help.\n\nMohamed Elneny - GO: Another player departing with his contract expiring. The right call by both parties. A good servant from the Arsene Wenger days.\n\nKai Havertz - STAY: Seems a bargain now at £65m from Chelsea following his barnstorming end to the season. Arteta bought him as a midfielder, yet now leads the line as a first-choice No.9.\n\nDeclan Rice - STAY: Arsenal’s most important and influential signing in years. Enough said.\n\nBukayo Saka - STAY: An undroppable superstar for club and country right now. Will undoubtedly get even better in seasons to come.\n\nGabriel Jesus - STAY: Fighting for a starting spot but right now but would be foolish to let him go given how much he can impact games and his winning mentality inside the group.\n\nGabriel Martinelli - STAY: A dip in form this term but Arteta has huge faith in him. The added competition with Leandro Trossard will only make him better.\n\nEddie Nketiah - GO: Career is at a crossroads right now and he needs to leave to turn that around. His six-figure wages could put Premier League suitors off.\n\nLeandro Trossard - STAY: Can bring his qualities as a starter or from the bench – a brilliant option to have when you are going for a title.\n\nReiss Nelson - GO: Arteta has often spoken of Nelson’s potential and likes having him around the squad, but his impact has withered over the past 12 months.\n\nSTAY in the know this summer with The Sun's transfer experts.\n\nChelsea have been given permission from Leicester to speak to Enzo Maresca.\n\nLiverpool and Chelsea are eyeing a summer move for Crysencio Summerville.\n\nPremier League clubs are targeting Tosin Adarabioyo, who will be a free agent when his Fulham contract expires next month.\n\nFollow our LIVE TRANSFER BLOG for all the latest deals, gossip and exclusives. \n\n\n\n©News Group Newspapers Limited in England No. 679215 Registered office: 1 London Bridge Street, London, SE1 9GF. \"The Sun\", \"Sun\", \"Sun Online\" are registered trademarks or trade names of News Group Newspapers Limited.

But in championship anything can happen and another final could be on the horizon.\n\nChris O'Donnell was notably absent from the indoor track at the start of this year.\n\nThe Sligo athlete was selected for the World Relays in the Bahamas but did not make the panel that ran in either round. This may leave some questions as to his current fitness, but a 46.30 clocking at the start of May over the 400m suggests a return to form.\n\nWith the Olympics in July, and the prospect of a medal in the mixed 4x400m, O'Donnell will be aiming to lower his season's best to be chosen to wear the singlet in Paris.\n\nOne notable question mark is 1500m runner Luke McCann. The 26-year-old was included as part of the initial list on Tuesday but is now noted on the European Athletics website as 'not entered'.\n\nThe governing body were unable to confirm his participation at this stage.\n\nMcCann has made a recent return to racing after injury, running a personal best in just his second race since September last year of 3.34.32.\n\nIt may be that McCann wants to focus on return to fitness and securing Olympic qualification. Championship racing can be a cagey affair and may not benefit athletes who have yet to qualify for the big dance in July.\n\nIf McCann had chosen to be included on the start list for Rome, it would have been a family affair, with his sister Jodie added to the team under the European ranking system for the 5000m.\n\nWatch The European Athletics Championships from 7-12 June on RTÉ2 and the RTÉ Player, follow reports and news on rte.ie/sport\n\n© RTÉ 2025.

Lauderhill, Florida, will host four matches.\n\nCricket boasts billion fans around the globe but few adherents in the lucrative North American market, where fans are more accustomed to watching New York Yankees slugger Aaron Judge picking up a bat than Rohit Sharma or Jos Buttler.\n\n\"This is the start of a journey,\" International Cricket Council (ICC) CEO Geoff Allardice told Reuters. \"The awareness that we're bringing in more elite cricket to the USA is something that's been a strategic priority for us.\"\n\n\n\n                            This aerial photo shows the Nassau County International Cricket Stadium under construction in Eisenhower Park in East Meadow, New York\n                                                            | Photo Credit: \n                                AFP\n                                                    \n\nThe journey started with Major League Cricket, which began play in the United States last year, and culminates with the 2028 Los Angeles Games, where cricket will be reintroduced to the Olympic programme for the first time since 1900.\n\nICC Twenty20 World Cup 2024: Full schedule, venues and complete squads \n\n\"In the lead up to the Los Angeles Olympics, I think we'll be continuing to try and raise the profile of cricket, not just for the established cricket fans in the USA but for new fans,\" said Allardice.\n\nThe tournament, which counts Jamaican track hero Usain Bolt as an ambassador, is a dream come true for U.S. immigrants, who comprise much of the sport's U.S. fan base and are more used to watching the action on television than in their own backyard.\n\n\"I mean, (India have) got some of the biggest names in world sport as part of their team,\" said Allardice. \"And to be able to get close to them and see them in action, I think it's an opportunity that's something that comes along (not) very often for cricket fans in the USA.\"\n\nThe ICC T20 World Cup runs from June 1-29. \n\nThe newly-built Nassau County International Cricket Stadium, near New York, was launched on Wednesday with the sport’s world body “excited” to conquer new territories through the T20 World Cup in June.\r\n\nLegends of T20 World Cup: Leading run-getters and batters with best strike rates\n\nThe 34,000-capacity stadium, with infrastructure from the Las Vegas Formula 1 circuit and drop-in pitches prepared in Florida, will host the hotly-anticipated India-Pakistan clash on June 9, among its eight scheduled World Cup games.\r\n\n\n\n                            Construction workers build the Nassau county International Cricket Stadium for the upcoming ICC Men’s T20 World Cup in Eisenhower Park in East Meadow in New York. The 34,000-capacity stadium, with infrastructure from the Las Vegas Formula 1 circuit and drop-in pitches prepared in Florida, will host the hotly-anticipated India-Pakistan clash on June 9, among its eight scheduled World Cup games. \n                                                            | Photo Credit: \n                                AFP\n                                                    \n\nThe showpiece 20-over event will be co-hosted by the West Indies and the United States starting June 1 with New York, Florida and Dallas as venues.\r\n\nThe International Cricket Council (ICC) remains happy with the focus on the India-Pakistan clash and the Nassau project as part of bringing the game to the US.\r\n\n“Yeah, absolutely! We can run that game anywhere and the interest in the fixture would be immense,” Chris Tetley, the ICC’s head of events, told reporters in a media roundtable.\r\n\n“The news stories that we have seen and the media coverage in the US itself as well as amongst the cricket media around the world. I have not seen that before around an ICC event.”\r\n\nTetley added: “We are really excited to bring the T20 World Cup cricket to the US and the opportunity that it presents to the sport and from what I can see there is an audience really waiting for us to come.”\r\n\nT20 Cricket will also feature as one of five new sports at the Los Angeles Olympics in 2028.\r\n\n\n\n                            A general view shows a media center the Nassau county International Cricket Stadium for the upcoming ICC Men’s T20 World Cup in Eisenhower Park in New York\n                                                            | Photo Credit: \n                                AFP\n                                                    \n\nMaking a cricket stadium in Nassau remained a huge challenge for the ICC, who got in Adelaide Oval curator Damian Hough for the job.\r\n\nHough created the first drop-in pitch in Adelaide in 2013 and the latest strips at the Nassau County ground promise good cricket and balance between bat and ball.\r\n\n“People shouldn’t be concerned about drop-in pitches,” said Hough.\r\n\n“They are proven around the world, definitely in Australia. Some of the best cricket is played on drop-in pitches and are really successful.”\n\n Published - May 30, 2024 05:00 pm IST\n\n\n                        Twenty20 World Cup\n                    \n                            /                      \n                        \n                        Twenty20\n                    \n                            /                      \n                        \n                        T20 World Cup 2024\n                    \n\n\n\t\t\t\t\tCopyright© 2025, THG PUBLISHING PVT LTD. or its affiliated companies.

Like there are demands on your ability to reproduce high speed - it takes a certain toll on my body. And I abused my body in XVs, you know, trying to come back from injury quick, not miss games, to a certain extent.\n\n\"Your body has to go through these growing pains and then perform.

In attack you're coming off the nine's hip or off the 10 or you're creating the extra man. In this game, I do that, I kill the team.\n\n\"So if I chase too hard into a ruck (in sevens) and I'm the third man around the ruck - it leaves four of us to 'D' (defend) a whole pitch and that's going to impact the team...\n\n\"At times, yeah, I've got a turnover or whatever and that's been beneficial. But you do that against the wrong team or you do that at the wrong time - I'm going to hurt the team... the runway's been short and it's a hard game like that... it's a really, really hard game.\"\n\nHooper will be on the Allianz Stadium sidelines for Stan at Friday's Super Rugby Pacific clash between the Waratahs and Reds.\n\nHe had enjoyed his foray into media more than he anticipated and it was refreshing no longer having to \"death ride\" rival teams.\n\nHooper added he was \"at peace\" if he missed out on selection.\n\nMichael Hooper (right) at Stan's Olympics launch at the Sydney Opera House. Stan\n\nHe instead will be a member of Stan's Olympics coverage if that occurs.\n\n\"I never thought I'd go to the Olympics.

It could have ended anywhere, and I am glad that I managed to pull through and go to the third set eventually, and win the game. \n\nThe start of the third set, we were both quite nervous, and I just try to think of my own initiative, and I am glad that it worked out,” expressed a relieved Loh after winning his opening match.\n\nLoh, currently ranked 12th in the world, expressed his gratitude for the home crowd’s support and hopes to excel and advance as far as possible in the Singapore Badminton Open. \n\nHe exited the competition early last year when he suffered a shocking defeat to Christo Popov in the second round. His best-ever finish was in 2022, when he faced current two-time defending champion Anthony Ginting in the semi-finals.\n\nThe 26-year-old is set to face world No. 4 Anders Antonsen (Denmark) in the Round of 16 on May 30, who defeated fellow countryman Rasmus Gemke in the opening round in straight sets, 21-17, 21-10.\n\nThe two shuttlers, Loh and Antonsen, have clashed five times in the past, with their first meeting at the BWF World Championships in 2021. On that occasion, Loh triumphed in the semi-finals and went on to win the championship title. \n\nSince their inaugural clash, Loh and Antonsen have engaged in a seesaw rivalry, with each player claiming two victories apiece in their four subsequent encounters.\n\nAntonsen emerged triumphant at the prestigious All England Open Badminton Championships in 2022 and the Korea Open in 2023.\n\n Loh Kean Yew exacted revenge in their most recent meetings, winning at the Denmark Open and China Open in 2023, setting the stage for a highly anticipated match on Thursday at the Singapore Indoor Stadium.\n\nThe home crowd also witnessed Yeo Jia Min’s valiant effort at the women’s singles event. Despite recovering from an Achilles injury in her recent tournament in Thailand, she pushed world No. 8 He Bing Jiao (China) to the limit in a thrilling three-sets encounter, ultimately succumbing 12-21, 23-21, 16-21.\n\n“I feel it is a bit wasted. The third set was really crucial at the start. I was not able to take the lead because there was unforced errors on my side, and I cannot adjust with the wind conditions as well. \n\nBut I tried my best to fight till the end. I hope that I can make myself play more consistent,” Yeo said during her post-match interview.\n\nMeanwhile, in the mixed doubles, Terry Hee and Jessica Tan fell to world No. 4 Seo Seung Jae and Chae Yu Jung from South Korea in straight sets, 14-21, 13-21. \n\nThis early exit marks a repeat of their fortunes from last year’s competition, where they also stumbled at the first hurdle. The husband-and-wife pair felt downcast about the results as they prepared for this tournament. \n\nBetween February and March, they embarked on a gruelling European tour, competing in five tournaments: the German Open, French Open, All England Badminton Championships, Swiss Open, and Madrid Spain Masters.\n\nAfter their whirlwind European adventure, they travelled to China in April for the Badminton Asia Championships. This was followed by a rigorous four-week training camp to focus on honing their strength and conditioning.\n\n“We were pretty disappointed because we have a pretty long solid block of training, and we really put in the work and effort to prepare hard for the Singapore Open.\n\nIt is our first tournament after five to six weeks so we were pretty upset that we did not manage to showcase what we have. We really prepared so hard for. We couldn’t find our momentum from the start, and we couldn’t get into the game,” lamented Tan.\n\nNow that the Singapore Badminton Open is over for the duo, their attention turns to the competition in Indonesia and Australia and preparing for the Paris Olympics in July. \n\nEarlier in the week, it was confirmed by the Badminton World Federation that Hee and Tan earned a spot at this year’s Olympic mixed doubles event. Loh (men’s singles) and Yeo (women’s singles) also qualified for the Olympics.\n\nWith the Singapore Badminton Open behind them, Hee and Tan are now shifting their focus to upcoming competitions in Indonesia and Australia while gearing up for the highly anticipated Paris Olympics in July.\n\nIn a significant development earlier in the week, the Badminton World Federation officially confirmed Hee and Tan’s qualification for the Olympic mixed doubles event.\n\n Joining them in their Olympic journey are Loh, who qualified for the men’s singles, and Yeo, who secured a spot in the women’s singles.\n\nHot this week\n\nPopular Categories\n\nThe Independent SG\n\n©\tThe Independent Singapore"

The description adds: “What happened between these so-called ‘best friends’?” The match in question was the women’s singles semifinal at Denmark Open. The ‘so-called best friends’ are, of course, PV Sindhu and Carolina Marin.\n\nOn Thursday at Singapore Open Super 750, they will take the court once again after that ill-tempered clash last October at Jyske Bank Arena. Water may have flown under the bridge, at least going by their social media posts since then, but there will be a definite edge. The screams will return from both sides, the big points will be celebrated with a roar, the shuttles will become the center of attraction even after the points are over. Bring out the popcorn.\n\nBoth Sindhu and Marin had winnable first-round fixtures, and the round-of-16 matchup appeared highly likely when the draw was made. Marin overcame the gritty Malaysian Goh Jin Wei 22-20, 21-18 seconds after Sindhu sealed her win against Line Hojmark Kjaersfeldt 21-12, 22-20.\n\nThe Indian though had to dig deep to seal it in straight games. Marin would have had one eye on this court as her win seemed imminent, whereas the Dane opened up a 20-16 advantage against Sindhu in Game 2.\n\nSindhu came to Singapore after spending 327 minutes on court during her runners-up finish last week in Malaysia. She has mentioned that she feels back to her physical best, but playing a potentially draining three-game first-round match a day before taking on Marin would have set her back even before a shuttle was hit in anger. And so Sindhu stepped on the gas, reeling off six straight points from 16-20 down to close out the match against Kjaersfeldt in straight games.\n\nFiesty clash in Denmark\n\nIn their 16-match head-to-head that stretches all the way back to 2011, Sindhu and Marin have often been involved in thrilling clashes, but that day in Odense, things reached a boiling point. Marin has had the better of the results over the years (leading 11-5 and most famously beating Sindhu to win gold at Rio Olympics) but Sindhu has never been one to shy away from a fight against the Spaniard.\n\nFrom the first game in Denmark, there was tension in the air, with Marin aggressively roaring and Sindhu responding too. The umpire issued warnings to both, asking them to tone down their celebrations, but it had little effect. Marin’s tendency to serve before her opponent was ready, eventually got to Sindhu. With Marin leading 8-2 in the decider, Sindhu decided to give it back verbally. “She’s shouting, so I am allowing her to shout,” she’d tell the umpire as she took a couple of steps back when Marin took her time to serve. “After she stops I’ll be ready.”\n\nThen Marin tried to do that thing where she rushes to the net to retrieve the shuttle after a point to keep the pace going if the momentum is on her side. Sindhu decided she’s not going to let that happen, so she too took a late decision to contest the dead shuttle. Rackets clashed. Angry words were exchanged. Sindhu was adamant the shuttle was on her side so Marin had no business reaching towards the other side. And finally, both players received yellow cards for unsportsmanlike conduct. It became the talk of the badminton community.\n\nMarin eventually coasted to a 21-7 scoreline in the decider but Sindhu showed enough sparks in the two first games.\n\nAfter the match, Sindhu posted on Instagram: “I’d like to request everyone not to spread hate. Emotions run high in the heat of the moment, but hating is not the solution.”\n\n“Both of us were fighting to win that game but on my side, I never wanted to fight against you personally. In front of everyone SORRY to show this kind of behaviour. See you soon mate!” replied the former Olympic champion. Sindhu agreed, “Things happen in the heat of the moment, Carolina.” A couple of friendly Instagram photos followed in the weeks to come as well.\n\nAnd so here we are, at the end of May, with the Olympic Games on the horizon, the two ‘so-called friends’ going at it again. Sindhu believes, on the back of her run in Kuala Lumpur, that she is moving well again. But no one will test her courtcraft more than Marin, with her up-tempo aggression during and between points. Sindhu perhaps was guilty of getting sucked into that vortex that day in Odense (who can blame her?) but she’ll know that standing up to Marin in terms of aggression is perhaps the easier part of it. Matching the lefty’s gameplay and countering her pace with clever changes of tempo will matter more.\n\nLakshya pushes Axelsen\n\nIn men’s singles, Lakshya Sen overcame a slow start to push world No. 1 Viktor Axelsen to the distance but eventually bowed out 21-13 16-21 21-13. In the latter half of the second game and at the start of the decider, Lakshya had Axelsen searching for answers with his use of slices, reverse slices, and half smashes crosscourt being put to good use. But the Great Dane eventually outmuscled Lakshya in the endgame. Axelsen’s huge celebration in the end was a measure of how much Lakshya had pushed him on the day, for only the second time their matchup resulted in a three-game affair. In defeat, there were positives to take for the Indian as he gears up for Paris.\n\nHS Prannoy, who came through a three-game battle against Belgium’s Julien Carraggi, is the last Indian standing in men’s singles. In women’s doubles, Paris-bound Ashwini Ponnappa and Tanisha Crasto were stunned by world No. 85 Polina Buhrova and Yevheniia Kantemyr but Treesa Jolly and Gayatri Gopichand prevailed in straight games to stay in contention.\n\n Vinayakk Mohanarangan is Senior Assistant Editor and is based in New Delhi.                        ...

It's good for his mind,\" Jackman told the RTÉ Rugby podcast.\n\nWe need your consent to load this YouTube contentWe use YouTube to manage extra content that can set cookies on your device and collect data about your activity. Please review their details and accept them to load the content.Manage Preferences\n\nThe former Leinster and Ireland hooker also believes Keenan's absence from the tour could have long-term benefits for Ireland XV's head coach Andy Farrell, who can use the summer to get more experience into other full-back options.\n\n\"I know he's coming back from an injury but in general he plays a hell of a lot of rugby. It helps Ireland, and it also helps Farrell find someone who can step in. It increases Ireland's depth.\n\n\"I also think the Sevens players who have done incredibly well without the XV's players, it's more acceptable because he has a background in that.\n\n\"They have to still make the squad, but I think it's brilliant for everybody,\" he added.\n\nFormer Munster and Leicester Tigers wing Johne Murphy joined Jackman on the podcast, and says Keenan deserves his chance to become an Olympian, having played a part in getting them to their previous Olympic Games in Tokyo in 2021.\n\n\"I think it's massive. When Sevens first became an Olympic sport, it's a massive draw for anyone who's an athlete of any kind. The opportunity to that is huge,\" Murphy said.\n\n\"He was very much part of the previous qualification. He went off, he was one of the players that went off and played a couple of years and came back and it's stood to him in terms of hiss skillset, his engine, everything.\n\n\"The Sevens are one of the favourites for a podium finish. Look at the golfers, Justin Rose and how he speaks about it. Even Rory [McIlroy], the last Olympics I remember him saying, 'I never tried so hard to finish third in my life'.\n\n\"It's just such a draw, and I think it's brilliant to see him, and what an opportunity, and what an experience to go and do it.\"\n\nWith Keenan out of commission for the South Africa tour, it leaves the 15 shirt available, with several players in contention to take it.\n\n\n\nPreviously, Mack Hansen (above) would have been seen as the ideal candidate to cover in the event of Keenan's unavailability.\n\nThe Connacht wing has been absent since New Year's Day due to a dislocated shoulder, which is taking longer than expected to heal.\n\nHansen looks unlikely to feature for Connacht in Friday's BKT United Rugby Championship meeting with Leinster at the RDS, which could be their final game of the season.\n\nAnd Murphy believes Hansen may benefit from being given the summer off, rather than touring South Africa.\n\n\"If you take a longer-term view on this, is it worth just giving him a break, giving him a full pre-season to be fully right.\n\n\"Going down for what's going to be an incredible tour down there would generally take you two and half or three games to get up to full speed anyway. Is it worth that?\n\n\"With Keenan going on the Sevens, and this, it gives them an opportunity to broaden their net, give guys more game-time and build a greater squad. They're going to need it again, they're going into a Lions year and Mack Hansen will be in that conversation if you go back on form.\n\n\"For me, if he's not right for this weekend, you're better off letting him take another couple of months, get completely refreshed and give it a lash from next September on,\" he added.\n\nListen to the RTÉ Rugby podcast on Apple Podcasts, Spotify or wherever you get your podcasts.\n\nWe need your consent to load this YouTube contentWe use YouTube to manage extra content that can set cookies on your device and collect data about your activity.

I’m not doing that,” Paul told Bleacher Report’s Chris Haynes on Friday, adding that his draft range has “been all over” the place. \n\nPaul explained that he’s not focused on honoring James’ desire to play with his son before he hangs up his jersey for good. \n\n“Well, LeBron said he wanted to play with his son. Bronny can’t do anything about that. And that’s nothing we should push back on,” Paul said. “If he wants to play with his son, that’s that. But again, I have a job to do representing Bronny and LeBron.\n\n“LeBron’s season’s over. I’m focused on Bronny and the rest of our draft class. If it aligns where he can play with his dad, great. Am I necessarily focused on that? No, not at all. I’m focused on a team-plan investment and a seriousness as it pertains to fit and opportunity.\n\n“We know that there’s gonna be some development necessary, but what does that actually look like? The teams I’ve talked to know exactly where I stand. I’m not going to bulls–t around in this process. We’re going to execute our plan.” \n\nJames — who will turn 40 in December — signed a two-year, $97.1 million contract extension with the Lakers in September 2022, which includes a player option for 2024-25 worth $51.4 million.\n\nHe has until June 29 to either opt into the final year of his contract with the Lakers or become an unrestricted free agent.\n\nIn April, Charania reported that the Lakers were “open to the prospect” of drafting Bronny. \n\nWhile at the draft combine in Chicago, Bronny told reporters that he isn’t focused on playing with his father. \n\nI asked Bronny James what would it mean to him if he played with his dad, LeBron James, on the Lakers. He replied, “When I get there, I don’t think it would be just like me and my dad. I would be happy about getting to the league instead of me thinking about playing with my dad.… pic.twitter.com/zjcHQYRvCj\n\n“My dream has always just been to put my name out, make a name for myself, and get to the NBA,” Bronny said at the time. “Which is everyone’s end goal that’s here. I never thought about just playing with my dad, but of course, he’s brought it up a couple of times. But yeah, I don’t think about it much.”\n\nJames declined to provide clarity when asked if he considered LA’s season-ending loss to the Nuggets in Game 5 of their first-round NBA playoff series as his last game in a purple and gold jersey.\n\n“I just want to get home to the family honestly,” he said, adding that he was planning to rest his body before training camp with USA Basketball for the Paris Olympics this summer.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement"

        "expanded content": "The Australian is pushing herself to new heights as she prepares for a tilt at Olympic glory in Paris – and personal fulfilment \n\nIn April, on the final day of the national titles in Adelaide, the Australian high jumper Nicola Olyslagers did something unusual. Having defended her championship crown by clearing 2.01m, with competitor Eleanor Patterson bowing out at 1.99m, Olyslagers could have called it a day and soaked in the success. If she wanted another attempt, she could have tried to equal her personal best, at 2.03m, or even beat it, at 2.04m.\n\nInstead, the Tokyo Olympics silver medallist lifted the bar by a full five centimetres, to 2.06m. It was a bold move, a statement in the lead-up to the Paris Olympics. It was not to be – Olyslagers could not quite cleanly clear the height. But it suggested that the 27-year-old will not be constrained by incremental improvement.\n\n“I did 2.01m and got the competition record, so that was great,” Olyslagers tells Guardian Australia by Zoom from her home on the New South Wales central coast. “But when I won indoors [last year’s World Athletics Indoor Championships], I had thought the next step was to go a few centimetres up, but I realised that the emotions had got to me and it was so difficult to focus and push myself to jump.”\n\nOlyslagers reflected with her team, and realised that in those crunch moments, she needed to go higher, to push herself to the limit. “When you attempt a personal best, you just have some extra focus, some extra strength, and you really go for it,” she says. “So my plan was always that, if I won, I would go from 2.01m to 2.06m, to get myself into that mindset. I’m trying to push myself. If I back out of doing something big, I’ll miss out.”\n\nThe women’s high jump world record was set at 2.09m by Bulgaria’s Stefka Kostadinova back in 1987. Few have come close to that mark since. Olyslagers admits that attempting 2.06m was “a little bit intimidating, when I saw how high it was”. But she takes heart from the effort. “My second attempt, I felt my whole body get over it – I was just too close [to the bar]. So now I know what I need to work on.\n\n“I’m really thankful that I did that. There’s a potential I could have cleared 2.04m at the Australian championships but that wasn’t my goal. My goal was to challenge myself, to get used to doing big increments.”\n\nOlyslagers (née McDermott) burst into the public consciousness three years ago at the Tokyo Olympics, with her effervescent attitude and striking habit of taking notes in a diary between each jump. During competition Olyslagers would sit down, retrieve her pen and paper, and score aspects of her jump out of 10. When she won the silver medal her successful jump earned full marks. “There were a few nines but overall I rounded up – I gave it a 10,” she said at the time.\n\nIt is a technique Olyslagers has continued in subsequent years, recalibrating the scale as she has continued to improve. Her personal best-breaking 2.03m warranted a 10 out of 10, but she says that “what would have been a 10/10 jump for me at the Tokyo Olympics maybe isn’t a 10/10 jump any more”.\n\nThe journalling serves an important purpose. “The reflection part is so important to me,” she says. “In between jumps there can be anywhere from a few minutes if I’m the only one left, or there’s just one other jumper – but if there’s 10 jumpers left, it could be 15 or 20 minutes between jumps. Being able to write it down is a way to switch off, save my energy, relax and rest and reset for the next jump. It’s the process that is the powerful part, as much as what I write down.”\n\nAnother central aspect of Olyslagers’ athletics career is her faith. The high-jumper co-founded a Christian ministry group, Everlasting Crowns, for fellow athletes. She jumps with a gold cross necklace.\n\n“My faith and Jesus is the reason I’m in sport,” she says. “I would not have made it here, and been able to navigate the highs and lows, without faith as my anchor. In sport, when you’re doing well, everyone wants to know, everyone loves you. When you don’t do well, everyone starts blaming you. It can be super challenging and lonely.”\n\nBefore 2017 Olyslagers’ identity was wrapped up in sport. “It was always No 1 for me, so if my performance wasn’t good, I wasn’t good.” She says following her faith in the subsequent years has been life-changing. “I decided to pursue God more than my sport, and find my whole worth in Him. It was an anchor for my soul – no matter what happened, I could always stay true to who I was, to what God says of me.”\n\nSign up to The Recap\n\nThe best of our sports journalism from the past seven days and a heads-up on the weekend’s action\n\nafter newsletter promotion\n\nIn this way, Olyslagers’ faith has helped her through her sporting journey – and it is now helping her to even higher heights. “Believing I can go higher than I’ve ever thought I could go requires me to have faith,” she says. “I wanted to be a two-metre jumper my whole life – and now I’m doing that in most competitions. So it’s like – what’s next? Because I know that no gold medal will add or take away my value, that I’m loved by God, I can just continue going through it and enjoy the journey.”\n\nWith the Olympics barely two months’ away, Olyslagers will shortly leave Australia to begin preparations – starting with outings at the Diamond League in Sweden in early June, then a string of competitions across Europe in the lead-up to Paris. “I’m feeling great,” she says. “I’ve come off my best season strength-wise. It doesn’t scare me [that the Olympics are so close]. I’m embracing it – I can’t wait to get overseas and see what’s possible.”\n\nAs the reigning indoor world champion, silver medallist in Tokyo and bronze medallist at last year’s world championships, Olyslagers will be among the favourites when her discipline takes centre-stage in early August. But the Australian says her focus will be on personal improvement rather than a gold medal.\n\n“In Paris my goal is to do a personal best,” she says. “For me it’s all about the height, the number. If I do a personal best and come 10th, I’ll be stoked. I want to do something I’ve never done before. That goal, that mindset, has taken my eyes off my competitors and helped me focus on my own training. When other girls are jumping high, past my personal best, I’m happy for them – it means more people are pushing me to go higher.\n\n“So with the Olympics I haven’t been looking at my competitors as barriers to my achievements – they’re actually helping me get the best out of myself,” she says. “I know I perform well when everyone else is performing well.”\n\nAthletes often say such things, and not always convincingly – they are platitudes, shields to the risk of public disappointment. But whether Olyslagers finishes first or fifth in Paris, there is a sense that personal achievement truly does means more to her than medals. Whatever the outcome, she will find strength in her notebook and her faith.\n\nBut would a gold medal deserve a new scale in the notepad? “You know,” she says, “I haven’t even thought if there’s an 11/10.”"

        "expanded content": "There's just one day to go at Roland-Garros in Paris, and you're in the right place to learn everything you need to know about how to watch a free French Open live stream from anywhere. That's right, you can see an Alcaraz vs. Zverev live stream, and the women's doubles final for free.\n\nCarlos Alcaraz looks to reclaim his world number-one position and a third grand slam. He'll have to get past an in-from Alexander Zverev who won the Italian Open recently and will be keen to pick up his first Grand Slam trophy. Both players had to battle through five-setters in the semis so endurance under the Parisian sun will be key.\n\nIf you're free a few hours before the men's final, be sure to check out the women's doubles final directly before it as there's some real star power in this one. Jasmine Paolini made it to the singles final this weekend, but Iga Swiatek was too much for her. Paolini has been brilliant, though, and earned plenty of new fans and a new top-10 ranking this week. Paolini and her fellow Italian, Sara Errani, take on the USA's Coco Gasuff and Czechia's Katerina Siniakova. You'll be able to watch it on the Tennis Channel in the US, and for free on France.TV in France (links below).\n\nSince this is a Grand Slam, coverage of the men's final is abundant throughout several countries. We'll show you how to tune in from anywhere via free live streams. It's a little more complicated in the US than standard tennis tournaments, so we've broken down everything you need to know about tuning in, including how to use a VPN to watch the Australian, Austrian, or French coverage for free from any country.\n\nThe French Open is airing across NBC, Peacock, and the Tennis Channel. Coverage will be shown on the Tennis Channel from 5 a.m. to 5:30 p.m. ET for the rest of this week's games. Then, on Saturday, we start with the Tennis Channel until 1 p.m. ET, but coverage will also be on NBC from 12-3 p.m. ET, and Peacock also has some action from 12:-5:30 p.m. ET. Saturday's schedule of channels is the same as Sunday's, too.\n\nSo you will only ever need NBC, Peacock, and the Tennis Channel to watch the entire competition in the US. Fortunately for cord-cutters, you'll only need to invest in two streaming services to get in on all the action. Sling TV, with the help of an add-on, should be able to get you access to NBC and the Tennis Channel. You'll need to select a Sling Blue base plan for NBC (although you should always double-check to ensure it's available in your area) and then select the Sports Extra add-on for the Tennis Channel. Sling Blue costs $40 a month, and Sports Extra costs $11 a month, so you'll pay $51 a month for this service. \n\n\n                          For just the essentials without any extra fluff, Sling TV is the streaming service you're looking for. It's more customizable than other plans, with three options you can choose from, so you pay for only what you need. New members often get a chunky discount on their first month.\n                        \n                      \n\nPeacock costs $5.99 a month and will carry select coverage. The service is NBC's streaming counterpart and carries several live sporting events, including comprehensive Olympics coverage.\n\n\n                      Peacock is a convenient streaming source for hit NBC TV shows, Universal movies, and select sports like Sunday Night Football. The service also carries its own slate of original programming.\n                    \n\nThe French Open live streams on 9Now's Gem channel in Australia. This free English-language streaming option only requires an account creation. Coverage is excellent on this network, which makes it a great pairing for a VPN if you're not in Australia right now but would like to keep watching. A VPN is also much cheaper than the US streaming services mentioned earlier.\n\n9Now doesn't carry every match, but the deeper we get into the tournament, you can expect the big matches to be shown here. If you want total access, you'll have to fork out for a Stan subscription, plus the Sports add-on.\n\nIf you'd prefer French or German commentary, there are also free French Open live streams in those countries, as detailed below.\n\nIn France, the French Open will live stream for free on France TV. You just need to create an account, and then you'll be ready to watch. Match selection is limited to a few courts at once, but expect the big names to appear regularly.\n\nServus TV is the Austrian home of French Open coverage. These live streams are free, and the service requires no log-in or account creation. Servus also has every other F1 race throughout the season (ORF1, also free, has the others and is also accessible from overseas via a VPN).\n\nIf you're outside any of the above countries during the competition and still want to access the streaming options, you can use a VPN. Short for virtual private networks, VPNs are handy ways to temporarily change your device's virtual location so that you can access your usual websites from anywhere. They're popular options for people looking to upgrade their online privacy and keep up with their apps while traveling abroad.\n\nOur go-to VPN recommendation is ExpressVPN. It's an easy-to-use option with a 30-day money-back guarantee. Check out our ExpressVPN review for additional information and keep reading to learn how to use a VPN.\n\n\n                          With its consistent performance, reliable security, and expansive global streaming features, ExpressVPN is the best VPN out there, excelling in every spec and offering many advanced features that make it exceptional. Better yet, you can save more than 60% right now and get up to four months free.\n                        \n\nHighlights\n\nNote: The use of VPNs is illegal in certain countries, and using VPNs to access region-locked streaming content might constitute a breach of the terms of use for certain services.

At the Indian army’s training ground in Fatehgarh, Uttar Pradesh eight years ago, the scrawny sardar held the weapon and took aim, producing a 2mm grouping at the practice target placed 300 metres away. A wave of bewilderment and disbelief swept through the trainees and instructors.\n\nSandeep’s career as a sports shooter thus began, on that dusty ground, on that nondescript day, with the instructors telling him he was a “complete natural who is born to shoot”.\n\n“I believe in God and destiny. How else could someone like me reach here?” he asks, a tinge of incredulity still evident.\n\nNow 28, the Naib Subedar attached to the Sikh Light Infantry has had a stop-start career so far. But a dream run at the Olympic Selection Trials (OST) held in April-May — in New Delhi and Bhopal — which he topped in the 10m air rifle event means the soft-spoken marksman is within touching distance of a first Olympics. The final call though rests with the selection committee, with the squad announcement for Paris expected soon.\n\n“I am confident of making the team. I hope NRAI honours its own policy,” he says. His anxiety stems from the discontent among his accomplished fellow shooters who he outscored at the trials. Sandeep edged Olympic quota winners Arjun Babuta and 2022 world champion Rudrankksh Patil – both started with an extra point as quota winners – to secure his qualification.\n\nSandeep’s stunning scores of 634.4 and 632.6 in the qualification rounds of the two competitions held in Delhi was followed by 631.6 and 628.3 in Bhopal. In shooting, the quota belongs to the country. And as per NRAI’s selection policy, the top two finishers at the trials in each event would go to the Olympics. With Sandeep on top and Babuta second, the chances of Patil and former world No.1 Divyansh Panwar of making it are all but over.\n\nPatil wrote to NRAI staking claim for a Paris berth, citing Sandeep’s relative inexperience at international level and his own earlier good performances. Sandeep is philosophical: “I believe in God”.\n\nHe says: “In my defence, I can say that being the eldest of the lot, I am calmer and mature, traits that are handy in shooting. It’s not that I am a complete novice. I have enough experience competing in pressure situations.\n\n“I approached the trials with an open mind. I had nothing to lose and I just tried to execute my training. I focussed on breathing and pulled the trigger; it is that simple. Not for a moment did I think about the person standing in the next lane. Given a chance, I will go to the Games with the same mindset.\"\n\nFor the man who has guarded India’s borders at the inhospitable Siachen Glacier, the pressure of firing pellets in the sanitised 10m range is pretty manageable. “Nothing can compare to that,” he says of the three months he spent in 2021 at the world’s highest battlefield. There was no enemy action, but among Sandeep’s big challenges at an altitude of 5,400m was breathing. With finger on the trigger, he would stand guard for six hours daily, staring at the icy wilderness.\n\n“Oxygen is really low up there, so breathing becomes a task. I would stand there, thinking about my shooting career,” he says. That was when Sandeep, who was in the reserves for the 2021 Tokyo Games, had failed a dope test following which he was suspended for a year and was also dismissed from the Army Marksmanship Unit in Mhow, Madhya Pradesh.\n\n“I kept thinking about my future. The mind kept wandering. Then, gradually I began to put my thoughts together. It is so serene and still there (Siachen) that you can ruminate all day,” he says. Eager to give competitive shooting another go, he requested his Commanding Officer (CO) to let him follow his dream.\n\n“CO sir knew my potential and sent me back to Delhi where I started shooting again. I went to Mhow and shot relentlessly. Coming into the OSTs, I consistently shot between 630-640 and did a lot of match simulations. All of that came good.”\n\nBorn in Behbal Khurd village in Punjab’s Faridkot, Sandeep had a tough upbringing. His father, Baljinder Singh, is a labourer. As a youngster, Sandeep would accompany his father to boost the family’s meagre income.\n\n“I have done everything, from lifting bricks at a construction site to doing masonry. Those were back-breaking days. The dream of an army job kept me going. We were so poor, sport was a luxury.” Sandeep’s elder brother is a motorcycle mechanic in the village and his younger brother is a student. “None of us had heard much about sports. I always looked at the army as my escape from that life,” says Sandeep, who is supported by the Reliance Foundation in areas of nutrition and psychology.\n\nHaving left his tough days behind, he is hopeful his first Olympics will help acquire the means to lift his family out of poverty. “It will be an honour to bring glory to the country. That’s what we are taught in the army,” he says. “Also, I want to give my father a happy retirement. A good show at the Olympics may help me do that.”\n\n\n\n"
